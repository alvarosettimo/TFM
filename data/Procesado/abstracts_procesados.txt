failure management and cost-aware traffic engineering are two important tasks done in network operation centers (noc). these are performed by expert technicians who must carefully analyze the network state and the flow of incoming alarms to decide how, where and when to take actions on the network. while based on implicit guiding principles, these network actions are very hard to automate with explicit rules due to the high complexity of the system; hence noc action is essentially a manual process today. to automate part of that process, in this paper we introduce an action recommendation engine (are) that can learn implicit noc action rules with supervised machine learning from historical data. as a result, are can recommend suitable action(s) to remedy network faults and engineer the traffic to minimize costs, all while maximizing the users’ quality of experience. to quantify the effectiveness of different noc action scenarios, we introduce the qoe-opex metric which balances between users’ quality of experience and isp’s operational costs. after proper model training on 56,000 data points with 66 features, we demonstrate that are can effectively reproduce implicit action-taking logic of noc technicians, thus moving us one step closer to reliable autonomous networks and fully-automated nocs.

recommender systems (rs) are ubiquitous in digital space. this paper develops a deep learning-based approach to address three practical challenges in rs: complex structures of high-dimensional data, noise in relational information, and the black-box nature of machine learning algorithms. our method—multi-graphgraph attention network (mg-gat)—learns latent user and business representations by aggregating a diverse set of information from neighbors of each user (business) on a neighbor importance graph. mg-gat out-performs state-of-the-art deep learning models in the recommendation task using two large-scale datasets collected from yelp and four other standard datasets in rs. the improved performance highlights mg-gat’s advantage in incorporating multi-modal features in a principled manner. the features importance, neighbor importance graph, and latent representations reveal business insights on predictive features and explainable characteristics of business and users. moreover, the learned neighbor importance graph can be used in a variety of management applications, such as targeting customers, promoting new businesses, and designing information acquisition strategies. our paper presents a quintessential big data application of deep learning models in management while providing interpretability essential for real-world decision-making.

recommender systems have become extremely important to various types of industries where customer interaction and feedback is paramount to the success of the business. for companies that face changes that arise with ever‐growing markets, providing product recommendations to new and existing customers is a challenge. our goal is to give our customers personalized recommendations based on what other similar people with similar portfolios have, in order to make sure they are adequately covered for their needs. our system uses customer characteristics in addition to customer portfolio data. since the number of possible recommendable products is relatively small, compared to other recommender domains, and missing data is relatively frequent, we chose to use bayesian networks for modeling our systems. we also present a deep‐learning‐based approach to provide recommendations to prospects (potential customers) where only external marketing data is available at the time of prediction.

since coronavirus has shown up, inaccessibility of legitimate clinical resources is at its peak, like the shortage of specialists and healthcare workers, lack of proper equipment and medicines etc. the entire medical fraternity is in distress, which results in numerous individual's demise. due to unavailability, individuals started taking medication independently without appropriate consultation, making the health condition worse than usual. as of late, machine learning has been valuable in numerous applications, and there is an increase in innovative work for automation. this paper intends to present a drug recommender system that can drastically reduce specialists heap. in this research, we build a medicine recommendation system that uses patient reviews to predict the sentiment using various vectorization processes like bow, tf-idf, word2vec, and manual feature analysis, which can help recommend the top drug for a given disease by different classification algorithms. the predicted sentiments were evaluated by precision, recall, f1score, accuracy, and auc score. the results show that classifier linearsvc using tf-idf vectorization outperforms all other models with 93% accuracy.

recommender systems algorithms are generally evaluated primarily on machine learning criteria such as recommendation accuracy or top-n precision. in this work, we evaluate six recommendation algorithms from a user-centric perspective, collecting both objective user activity data and subjective user perceptions. in a field experiment involving 1508 users who participated for at least a month, we compare six algorithms built using machine learning techniques, ranging from supervised matrix factorization, contextual bandit learning to q learning. we found that the objective design in machine-learning-based recommender systems significantly affects user experience. specifically, a recommender optimizing for implicit action prediction error engages users more than optimizing for explicit rating prediction error when modeled with the classical matrix factorization algorithms, which empirically explains the historical transition of recommender system research from modeling explicit feedback data to implicit feedback data. however, the action-based recommender is not as precise as the rating-based recommender in that it increases not only positive engagement but also negative engagement, e.g., negative action rate and user browsing effort which are negatively correlated with user satisfaction. we show that blending both explicit and implicit feedback from users through an online learning algorithm can gain the benefits of engagement and mitigate one of the possible costs (i.e., the increased browsing effort).

web development without an integrated structure makes lots of difficulties for users. web personalization systems are presented to make the website compatible with interest of users in both aspects of contents and services. in this paper extracting user navigation patterns is used to capture similar behaviors of users in order to increase the quality of recommendations. based on patterns extracted from the same user navigation, recommendations are provided to the user to make it easier to navigate. recently, web browsing techniques have been widely used for personalization. in this study, a method is proposed to create a user profile with the web usage mining by clustering and neural networks in order to predict the user's future requests and then generate a list of the pages of user's favorites. simulation results shows that proposed method will increase the accuracy of recommender systems.

conventional recommender systems are required to train the recommendation model using a centralized database. however, due to data privacy concerns, this is often impractical when multi-parties are involved in recommender system training. federated learning appears as an excellent solution to the data isolation and privacy problem. recently, graph neural network (gnn) is becoming a promising approach for federated recommender systems. however, a key challenge is to conduct embedding propagation while preserving the privacy of the graph structure. few studies have been conducted on the federated gnn-based recommender system. our study proposes the first vertical federated gnn-based recommender system, called verfedgnn. we design a framework to transmit: (i) the summation of neighbor embeddings using random projection, and (ii) gradients of public parameter perturbed by ternary quantization mechanism. empirical studies show that verfedgnn has competitive prediction accuracy with existing privacy preserving gnn frameworks while enhanced privacy protection for users' interaction information.

recent studies have shown that robust diets recommended to patients by dietician or an artificial intelligent automated medical diet based cloud system can increase longevity, protect against further disease, and improve the overall quality of life. however, medical personnel are yet to fully understand patient-dietician’s rationale of recommender system. this paper proposes a deep learning solution for health base medical dataset that automatically detects which food should be given to which patient base on the disease and other features like age, gender, weight, calories, protein, fat, sodium, fiber, cholesterol. this research framework is focused on implementing both machine and deep learning algorithms like, logistic regression, naive bayes, recurrent neural network (rnn), multilayer perceptron (mlp), gated recurrent units (gru), and long short-term memory (lstm). the medical dataset collected through the internet and hospitals consists of 30 patient’s data with 13 features of different diseases and 1000 products. product section has 8 features set. the features of these iomt data were analyzed and further encoded before applying deep and machine and learning-based protocols. the performance of various machine learning and deep learning techniques was carried and the result proves that lstm technique performs better than other scheme with respect to forecasting accuracy, recall, precision, and $f1$ -measures. we achieved 97.74% accuracy using lstm deep learning model. similarly 98% precision, 99% recall and $99\%~f1$ -measure for allowed class is achieved, and for not-allowed class precision is 89%, recall score is 73% and $f1$ measure score is 80%.

a decision-making system is one of the most important tools in data mining. the data mining field has become a forum where it is necessary to utilize users' interactions, decision-making processes and overall experience. nowadays, e-learning is indeed a progressive method to provide online education in long-lasting terms, contrasting to the customary head-to-head process of educating with culture. through e-learning, an ever-increasing number of learners have profited from different programs. notwithstanding, the highly assorted variety of the students on the internet presents new difficulties to the conservative one-estimate fit-all learning systems, in which a solitary arrangement of learning assets is specified to the learners. the problems and limitations in well-known recommender systems are much variations in the expected absolute error, consuming more query processing time, and providing less accuracy in the final recommendation. the main objectives of this research are the design and analysis of a new transductive support vector machine-based hybrid personalized hybrid recommender for the machine learning public data sets. the learning experience has been achieved through the habits of the learners. this research designs some of the new strategies that are experimented with to improve the performance of a hybrid recommender. the modified one-source denoising approach is designed to preprocess the learner dataset. the modified anarchic society optimization strategy is designed to improve the performance measurements. the enhanced and generalized sequential pattern strategy is proposed to mine the sequential pattern of learners. the enhanced transductive support vector machine is developed to evaluate the extracted habits and interests. these new strategies analyze the confidential rate of learners and provide the best recommendation to the learners. the proposed generalized model is simulated on public datasets for machine learning such as movies, music, books, food, merchandise, healthcare, dating, scholarly paper, and open university learning recommendation. the experimental analysis concludes that the enhanced clustering strategy discovers clusters that are based on random size. the proposed recommendation strategies achieve better significant performance over the methods in terms of expected absolute error, accuracy, ranking score, recall, and precision measurements. the accuracy of the proposed datasets lies between 82 and 98%. the mae metric lies between 5 and 19.2% for the simulated public datasets. the simulation results prove the proposed generalized recommender has a great strength to improve the quality and performance.

federated learning (fl) is a popular distributed machine learning paradigm that enables devices to work together to train a centralized model without transmitting raw data. however, when the model becomes complex, mobile devices’ communication overhead can be unacceptably large in traditional fl methods. to address this problem, federated distillation (fd) is proposed as a federated version of knowledge distillation. most of the recent fd methods calculate the model output (logits) of each client as the local knowledge on a public proxy dataset and do distillation with the average of the clients’ logits on the server side. nevertheless, these fd methods are not robust and perform poorly in the non-iid (data is nonindependent and non-identically distributed) scenario such as federated recommendation (fr). in order to eliminate the non-iid problem and apply fd in fr, we proposed a novel method named feddyn to construct a proxy dataset and extract local knowledge dynamically in this paper. in this method, we replaced the average strategy with focus distillation to strengthen reliable knowledge, which solved the non-iid problem that the local model has biased knowledge. the average strategy is a dilution and perturbation of knowledge since it treats reliable and unreliable knowledge equally important. in addition, to prevent inference of private user information from local knowledge, we used a method like local differential privacy techniques to protect this knowledge on the client side. the experimental results showed that our method has a faster convergence speed and lower communication overhead than the baselines on three datasets, including movielens-10ok, movielens-im and pinterest.

programming education has recently received increased attention due to growing demands for programming and information technology skills. however, a lack of teaching materials and human resources presents a major challenge to meeting the growing demand for programming education. one way to compensate for a shortage of trained teachers is to use machine learning techniques to assist learners. therefore, we propose a learning path recommendation system based on a learner’s ability charts by means of a recurrent neural network. in brief, a learning path is constructed from a learner’s submission history with a trial-and-error process, and the learner’s ability chart is used as a barometer of their current knowledge. in this paper, an approach for constructing a learning path recommendation system by using ability charts and its implementation based on a sequential prediction model by a recurrent neural network, are presented. experimental evaluation with data from an e-learning system is also provided.

while recent years have witnessed a rapid growth of research papers on recommender system (rs), most of the papers focus on inventing machine learning models to better fit user behavior data. however, user behavior data is observational rather than experimental. this makes various biases widely exist in the data, including but not limited to selection bias, position bias, exposure bias, and popularity bias. blindly fitting the data without considering the inherent biases will result in many serious issues, e.g., the discrepancy between offline evaluation and online metrics, hurting user satisfaction and trust on the recommendation service, and so on. to transform the large volume of research models into practical improvements, it is highly urgent to explore the impacts of the biases and perform debiasing when necessary. when reviewing the papers that consider biases in rs, we find that, to our surprise, the studies are rather fragmented and lack a systematic organization. the terminology “bias” is widely used in the literature, but its definition is usually vague and even inconsistent across papers. this motivates us to provide a systematic survey of existing work on rs biases. in this paper, we first summarize seven types of biases in recommendation, along with their definitions and characteristics. we then provide a taxonomy to position and organize the existing work on recommendation debiasing. finally, we identify some open challenges and envision some future directions, with the hope of inspiring more research work on this important yet less investigated topic. the summary of debiasing methods reviewed in this survey can be found at https://github.com/jiawei-chen/recdebiasing.

nowadays a big challenge when going out to a new restaurant or cafe, people usually use websites or applications to look up nearby places and then choose one based on an average rating. but most of the time the average rating isn't enough to predict the quality or hygiene of the restaurant. different people have different perspectives and priorities when evaluating a restaurant. many online businesses now have implemented personalized recommendation systems which basically try to identify user preferences and then provide relevant products to enhance the users experience . in turn, users will be able to enjoy exploring what they might like with convenience and ease because of the recommendation results. finding an ideal restaurant can be a struggle because the mainstream recommender apps have not yet adopted the personalized recommender approach. so we took up this challenge and we aim to build the prototype of a personalized recommender system that incorporates metadata which is basically the information provided by interactions of customers and restaurants online(reviews), which gives a pretty good idea of customers satisfaction and taste as well as features of the restaurant. this type of approach enhances user experience of finding a restaurant that suits their taste better. this paper has used a package called lightfm(the library of python for implementing popular recommendation algorithms) and the dataset from yelp. there are different methods of filtering the data, here we have used hybrid filtering which is a combination of content-based filtering (cbf) and collaborative filtering (cf). since the results from hybrid filtering are far more closer to accuracy than cbf or cf respectively. then hybrid filtering gives results in the form of personalized recommendations for users after training and testing of the data

recommender systems add significant benefits to e-commerce in terms of sale conversion, revenues, customer experience, loyalty and lifetime value. but the recommendations from these systems do not change on inputs beyond user and item profile and transaction data. there have been some attempts in the past to optimize on more varied data in recommenders, example of which is the location based recommenders. but location is just one dimension of the state that a user could have shared with gps/glonass/baideu sensor available in most smartphones. with an upcoming era of smart-wears and pervasive iots, there are a lot many other dimensions of a user state which can be utilized to optimize upon the concept of optimal state recommender solutions. this paper suggests upgrading from conventional recommendations that are based on user/ item preferences alone with systems that provide the best recommendation at the most optimal state when the user is most receptive to accept the recommendation, the “optimal state recommendation solution” and proposes solutions and architectures to overcome the challenges of dealing with real time, distributed machine learning on iot scale data in implementing this solution. the paper leverages some of the advance distributed machine learning algorithms like variants of distributed kalman filters, distributed alternating least square recommenders, distributed mini-batch stochastic gradient descent(sgd) based classifiers, and highly scalable distributed computation and machine learning platforms like apache spark, (apache) spark mllib, spark streaming, python/pyspark, r/sparkr, apache kafka in an high performance, distributed, fault tolerant architecture. the solution also aspires to be compliant with upcoming iot standards and architectures like ieee p2413 to provide a standard solution for such problems beyond the current scope of this paper.

video-game players generate huge amounts of data, as everything they do within a game is recorded. in particular, among all the stored actions and behaviors, there is information on the in-game purchases of virtual products. such information is of critical importance in modern free-to-play titles, where gamers can select or buy a profusion of items during the game in order to progress and fully enjoy their experience. to try to maximize these kind of purchases, one can use a recommendation system so as to present players with items that might be interesting for them. such systems can better achieve their goal by employing machine learning algorithms that are able to predict the rating of an item or product by a particular user. in this paper we evaluate and compare two of these algorithms, an ensemble-based model (extremely randomized trees) and a deep neural network, both of which are promising candidates for operational video-game recommender engines. item recommenders can help developers improve the game. but, more importantly, it should be possible to integrate them into the game, so that users automatically get personalized recommendations while playing. the presented models are not only able to meet this challenge, providing accurate predictions of the items that a particular player will find attractive, but also sufficiently fast and robust to be used in operational settings.

the advent of machine learning provides a new angle to solver different real-time challenges in business and research applications. in general, machine learning is nothing but the greater conversion of traditional mathematics application. machine learning models play a significant role in facial recognition applications. facial recognition is used in many real-time applications like security systems, automated attendance, offices etc. one of the important applications of machine learning models is movie recommendation using facial detection. this has been carried out by capturing the emotion to save time of the user rather than searching individual movies. some relevant research works are carried out based on the attentional convolutional neural (recognizes each facial micro expression) and recommender system has been implemented to provide either the movies or song based on the output received from previous input i.e. cnn. another work implemented for facial recognition using decision trees, boosting algorithms has been proven to be very inefficient compared to cnn. so, cnn seems more appropriate to obtain the best possible accuracy. also, the combination of both the types of recommendation system i.e. content based and collaborative filtering offers more power for recommender system.

currently, the user profile based online recommender system has become a hit both in research and engineering domain. accurately capturing users' profile is the key of recommendation. recently, lots of researches on user profile extraction have been launched, including content-based recommendation. to better capture users' profiles, a three-step profiling method is adopted in this work. (1) purchase item prediction is made based on logistic regression. (2) purchase category prediction is made based on support vector machine (svm), and (3) user's rating prediction is made based on convolutional neural network (cnn) and long short-term memory (lstm). this work outperformed the baseline model on the user dataset collected from amazon. so, in conclusion, the work has the ability of giving reasonable recommendation for users who would like to purchase online. in the future, the video signal processing techniques will also be taken under consideration to capture users' face expression for better recommendation.

learning materials are increasingly available on the web making them an excellent source of information for building e-learning recommendation systems. however, learners often have difficulty finding the right materials to support their learning goals because they lack sufficient domain knowledge to craft effective queries that convey what they wish to learn. the unfamiliar vocabulary often used by domain experts creates a semantic gap between learners and experts, and also makes it difficult to map a learner's query to relevant learning materials. we build an e-learning recommender system that uses background knowledge extracted from a collection of teaching materials and encyclopedia sources to support the refinement of learners' queries. our approach allows us to bridge the gap between learners and teaching experts. we evaluate our method using a collection of realistic learner queries and a dataset of machine learning and data mining documents. evaluation results show our method to outperform benchmark approaches and demonstrates its effectiveness in assisting learners to find the right materials.

coordination failure reduces match quality among employers and candidates in the job market, resulting in a large number of unfilled positions and/or unstable, short-term employment. centralized job search engines provide a platform that connects directly employers with job-seekers. however, they require users to disclose a significant amount of personal data, i.e., build a user profile, in order to provide meaningful recommendations. in this paper, we present privatejobmatch - a privacy-oriented deferred multi-match recommender system - which generates stable pairings while requiring users to provide only a partial ranking of their preferences. privatejobmatch explores a series of adaptations of the game-theoretic gale-shapley deferred acceptance algorithm which combine the flexibility of decentralized markets with the intelligence of centralized matching. we identify the shortcomings of the original algorithm when applied to a job market and propose novel solutions that rely on machine learning techniques. experimental results on real and synthetic data confirm the benefits of the proposed algorithms across several quality measures. over the past year, we have implemented a privatejobmatch prototype and deployed it in an active job market economy. using the gathered real-user preference data, we find that the match recommendations are superior to a typical decentralized job market---while requiring only a partial ranking of the user preferences.

different efforts have been made to address the problem of information overload on the internet. recommender systems aim at directing users through this information space, toward the resources that best meet their needs and interests. web content recommendation has been an active application area for information filtering, web mining and machine learning research. recent studies show that combining the conceptual and usage information can improve the quality of web recommendations. in this paper we exploit this idea to enhance a reinforcement learning framework, primarily devised for web recommendations based on web usage data. a hybrid web recommendation method is proposed by making use of the conceptual relationships among web resources to derive a novel model of the problem, enriched with semantic knowledge about the usage behavior. with our hybrid model for the web page recommendation problem we show the apt and flexibility of the reinforcement learning framework in the web recommendation domain, and demonstrate how it can be extended in order to incorporate various sources of information. we evaluate our method under different settings and show how this method can improve the overall quality of web recommendations.

doi: 10.14254/2071789x.2018/11-4/11 abstract. this study continues a series of studies on the effectiveness of scientific conferences. this topic has not been sufficiently investigated although it receives large funds, assuming that these conferences have added value for staff members' academic-professional development. predicated on questionnaires filled by 96 academic staff members from 17 different departments, we found that when choosing conferences to attend, the type of faculty affect the search for cooperation. moreover, staff members from the faculty of natural sciences attribute more significance to conferences that result in publications than staff members from the faculty of health. the faculty of engineering creates negative mediation in the correlation between gender and cooperation. namely, the faculty of engineering does not urge cooperation and even has a negative effect, but its effect is evident mainly among men. this finding complements prior research findings showing that women are more inclined to cooperation (eckhaus & davidovitch, 2018a). the current findings show that the inclination to cooperation is not related only to gender issues rather the faculty has an effect as well. the current findings might have a contribution to the significance of the faculty as an influential factor of conferences on cooperation – and in fact on the professional development of staff members.

anti-neutrophil cytoplasmatic antibody (anca) associated vasculitis (aav) is a rare, life-threatening, systemic auto-immune disease.[1]due to the low prevalence, multiple treating disciplines and poor registration, including icd-10 classification, identifying aav patients for (pre-)clinical studies, research and health care evaluation is challenging.[2, 3]therefore, there is an urgent need to improve identifying these patients in health care organisations. employing artificial intelligence (ai) – supported search engines are increasingly suggested to achieve this.reliably identify aav patients in electronic health records (ehr) using an ai-based tool that incorporates text mining and natural language processing (nlp).the identification method consists of a search strategy combined with nlp-based exclusion. a search strategy to optimally identify aav patients within a single center ehr system of an academic hospital was developed using an established aav cohort (n=203) as a gold-standard reference set. patient records, identified by the search strategy outside of the reference set, underwent manual review to confirm newly-identified aav patients. then, improvement in performance by adding nlp to the text-mining search strategy was investigated. validation was performed on an independent ehr system of a non-academic hospital with an established aav cohort available for reference (n=84).the search strategy combined five queries based on disease description, laboratory measurements, medication and relevant specialisms. in the determination ehr, the search strategy identified 608 patients, including 197/203 (97.0%) aav patients of the reference set and 149 newly-identified aav cases confirmed by manual review. employing nlp in the identification method improved the positive predictive value (ppv) from 57% (346/608 patients) to 78% (339/444 patients). these results were validated in an independent ehr system where the search strategy identified 333 patient, including 82/84 (97.6%) aav patients of the reference set and 112 newly-identified aav cases upon manual review. nlp improved ppv from 59% (194/333 patients) to 86% (192/223 patients). negative predictive values and specificities were above 98% in all analyses.we present an ai based identification method to identify low-prevalent aav patients in ehr systems. we demonstrated improved performance when adding nlp to the text-mining search strategy. successful validation in an independent health organisation supports the applicability and transportability of this method which can be an important accelerator for research efforts and health care evaluation in aav patients.[1]kitching ar, anders hj, basu n, brouwer e, gordon j, jayne dr, et al. anca-associated vasculitis. nat rev dis primers. 2020;6(1):71.[2]quan h, li b, saunders ld, parsons ga, nilsson ci, alibhai a, et al. assessing validity of icd-9-cm and icd-10 administrative data in recording clinical conditions in a unique dually coded database. health serv res. 2008;43(4):1424-41.[3]spierings j bt, dirikgil e, moens hb. overdaad aan icd-coderingen hindert onderzoek. medisch contact. 2020;22:18-20.nil.jolijn van leeuwen: none declared, erik penne: none declared, y.k. onno teng consultant of: ykot received an unrestricted research grant and consultancy fees from vifor pharma., grant/research support from: the work of ykot was supported by the dutch kidney foundation (17okg04) and by the arthritis research and collaboration hub foundation. arthritis research and collaboration hub is funded by dutch arthritis foundation (reumanederland).

in the field of natural language processing (nlp), keywords are crucial for enhancing information retrieval (ir) and content summarization, as well as for optimizing search engines and organizing documents. as the volume of generated information increases, identifying keywords manually from large documents becomes more challenging and no longer feasible. therefore, automatic keyword extraction is necessary as a cost-effective method to handle large documents and to provide scalable solutions for various applications in nlp and information management. in the academic domain, automatic keyword extraction simplifies the process of finding and categorizing scientific publications, enabling paper repositories to optimize their ir and document organizing systems. however, many methods of keyword extraction use either global semantic features based on pre-trained embedding models or local statistical features separately, which yields low results. since a good keyword must be identified by both external knowledge and local statistical features, this paper proposes a method to improve the performance of keyword extraction from scientific publications by combining local statistical features with embedding models. the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods with an f-score of 0.70 on the semeval2017 dataset using the scibert model and svm classifier. this research confirms that both local statistical information and contextualized semantic information are important to identify keywords.

information retrieval system is taking an important role in current search engine which performs searching operation based on keywords which results in enormous amount of data available to the user, from which user cannot figure out the essential and most important information. this limitation may be overcome by a new web architecture known as semantic web which overcome the limitation of keyword based search technique called conceptual or semantic search technique. natural language processing technique is mostly implemented in qa system for asking user's question and several steps are also followed for conversion of questions to query form for getting an exact answer. in conceptual search, search engine interprets the meaning of user's query and the relation among the concepts that documents contains with respect to a particular domain that produces specific answers instead of giving list of answers. in this paper, we proposed ontology based semantic information retrieval system and jena semantic web framework in which, user enters an input query which is parsed by standford parser then triplet extraction algorithm is used. to all input query, sparql query is formed and then it is fired on the knowledge base (ontology) that finds appropriate rdf triples in knowledge base and retrieve the relevant information using jena framework.

the increasing volume, variety, velocity, distribution, structural intricacy, and complexity of use of digital evidence can make it difficult for practitioners to find and understand the most forensically useful information (casey e. digital evidence and computer crime: forensic science, computers, and the internet. academic press; 2011. p. 31; pollitt m. the hermeneutics of the hard drive: using narratology, natural language processing, and knowledge management to improve the effectiveness of the digital forensic process [phd dissertation]. university of central florida; 2011). digital forensic practitioners currently search for information and solutions in an ad hoc manner, leading to results that are unstructured, unverified, and sometimes incomplete. as a result, certain digital evidence is being missed or misinterpreted. to mitigate risks of knowledge gaps, there is a pressing need for a systematic mechanism that practitioners can use to codify and combine their collective knowledge. this work presents the design and development of a solution that catalogs crowdsourced knowledge of digital forensic artifacts in a well‐structured, easily searchable form to support efficient and automated extraction of pertinent information, improving availability and reliability of interpretation of artifacts (general acceptance). technical implementation and artifact curation are discussed with illustrative examples and recommendations for future work.

though computational linguistics (cl) dates back to the first efforts in machine translation in the mid 1950s, it is only in the last decade or so that it has had a substantial impact on literary studies through the statistical techniques of corpus linguistics and data mining (know as natural language processing, nlp). in this essay i briefly review the history of computational linguistics from its early days involving symbolic computing to current developments in nlp and set that in relationship to academic literary study. in particular, i discuss the deeply problematic struggle that literary study has had with the question of evaluation: what makes good literature? i argue that literary studies should own up to this tension and recognize a distinction between ethical criticism, which is explicitly concerned with values, and naturalist criticism, which sidesteps questions of value in favor of understanding how literature works in the mind and in culture. i then argue that the primary relationship between cl and nlp and literary studies should be through naturalist criticism. i conclude by discussing the relative roles of cl and nlp in a large-scale and long-term investigation of romantic love.

in recent years, because of the advancements in communication and networking technologies, mobile technologies have been developing at an unprecedented rate. mhealth, the use of mobile technologies in medicine, and the related research has also surged parallel to these technological advancements. although there have been several attempts to review mhealth research through manual processes such as systematic reviews, the sheer magnitude of the number of studies published in recent years makes this task very challenging. the most recent developments in machine learning and text mining offer some potential solutions to address this challenge by allowing analyses of large volumes of texts through semi-automated processes. the objective of this study is to analyze the evolution of mhealth research by utilizing text-mining and natural language processing (nlp) analyses. the study sample included abstracts of 5,644 mhealth research articles, which were gathered from five academic search engines by using search terms such as mobile health, and mhealth. the analysis used the text explorer module of jmp pro 13 and an iterative semi-automated process involving tokenizing, phrasing, and terming. after developing the document term matrix (dtm) analyses such as single value decomposition (svd), topic, and hierarchical document clustering were performed, along with the topic-informed document clustering approach. the results were presented in the form of word-clouds and trend analyses. there were several major findings regarding research clusters and trends. first, our results confirmed time-dependent nature of terminology use in mhealth research. for example, in earlier versus recent years the use of terminology changed from "mobile phone" to "smartphone" and from "applications" to "apps". second, ten clusters for mhealth research were identified including (i) clinical research on lifestyle management, (ii) community health, (iii) literature review, (iv) medical interventions, (v) research design, (vi) infrastructure, (vii) applications, (viii) research and innovation in health technologies, (ix) sensor-based devices and measurement algorithms, (x) survey-based research. third, the trend analyses indicated the infrastructure cluster as the highest percentage researched area until 2014. the research and innovation in health technologies cluster experienced the largest increase in numbers of publications in recent years, especially after 2014. this study is unique because it is the only known study utilizing text-mining analyses to reveal the streams and trends for mhealth research. the fast growth in mobile technologies is expected to lead to higher numbers of studies focusing on mhealth and its implications for various healthcare outcomes. findings of this study can be utilized by researchers in identifying areas for future studies.

searching data is a natural behavior of humankind and is also a fundamental operation in both industrial and academic areas. there has been research into developing sophisticated methods and techniques for string searching. the common method is to make use of prefixes and suffixes to move through the text while searching a string query in a text. it suffers from high computational complexity since it has to repeatedly search each character in the string query sequentially. in this paper, we address the difficulty and propose a novel approach that enables a parallel search of the text without indexing the text or the query which is needed for sequential search. the proposed approach utilizes an xnor operation in conjunction with the shift method to find the instance of a query. we validated it through experiments finding improvement against other methods.

name disambiguation, which aims to identify multiple names which correspond to one person and same names which refer to different persons, is one of the most important basic problems in many areas such as natural language processing, information retrieval and digital libraries. microsoft academic search data in kdd cup 2013 track 2 task brings one such challenge to the researchers in the knowledge discovery and data mining community. besides the real-world and large-scale characteristic, the track 2 task raises several challenges: (1) consideration of both synonym and polysemy problems; (2) existence of huge amount of noisy data with missing attributes; (3) absence of labeled data that makes this challenge a cold start problem. in this paper, we describe our solution to track 2 of kdd cup 2013. the challenge of this track is author disambiguation, which aims at identifying whether authors are the same person by using academic publication data. we propose a multi-phase semi-supervised approach to deal with the challenge. first, we preprocess the dataset and generate features for models, then construct a coauthor-based network and employ community detection to accomplish first-phase disambiguation task, which handles the cold-start problem. second, using results in first phase, we use support vector machine and various other models to utilize noisy data with missing attributes in the dataset. further, we propose a self-taught procedure to solve ambiguity in coauthor information, boosting performance of results from other models. finally, by blending results from different models, we finally achieves 6th place with 0.98717 mean f-score on public leaderboard and 7th place with 0.98651 mean f-score on private leaderboard.

the scholarly literature produced by human civilization will soon be considered small data, able to be portably conveyed by the network and carried on personal machines. this semi-structured text centric knowledge base is a focus of attention for scholars, as the wealth of facts, facets and connections in scholarly documents are large. such machine analysis can derive insights that can inform policy makers, academic and industrial management, as well as scholars as authors themselves. there is another underserved community of scholarly document users that has been overlooked: the readers themselves. i call for the community to put more efforts towards supporting our own scholars (especially beginning scholars, new to the research process) with automation from information retrieval and natural language processing. techniques that mine information from within the full text of a document could be used to introspect a digital library's materials, inferring better search metadata, improving scholarly document recommendation, and aiding the understanding of the text, figures, presentations and citations of our scholarly literature. such an introspective digital library will enable scholars to assemble an understanding of other scholars' work more efficiently, and provide downstream machine reading applications with input for their analytics.

the ntu corpus of formosan languages (http://corpus.linguistics.ntu.edu .tw) started as one of the sub-projects of the multimedia laboratory established by the center for information and electronicstechnologies.the corpus integrates the professional and academic works of various departments and colleges1 at national taiwan university, with a view to establish a standard for the creation of linguistic corpora databases through the application of information technology on linguistics research. the development of natural language processing techniques and dynamic web technology has generated wide interest in the construction of an integrated platform which enables people to submit, browse and search among collected texts against established corpora. for seriously endangered languages, corpus documentation plays a crucial role in preserving the precious linguistic and cultural data. the ntu corpus of formosan languages is constructed for the purpose of preserving austronesian languages spoken in taiwan, many of which are on the verge of extinction. it is the result of our effort in providing a multilingual on-line corpus with multimedia capability to meet the needs of both linguists and those interested. it features: (i) discourse-oriented documentation that goes beyond sentential level, (ii) retrieval with cross-referencing capability, (iii) ethnolinguistic notes preserving precious cultural information, and (iv) multi-media data with interoperability with different systems for the greatest interest of the users. to record faithfully discourse data collected, we incorporate in our corpus interactional linguistic features such as pauses, hesitations, fillers, repetitions, false starts etc.approaching language from a functional approach, we believe linguistic features as such are non-trivial in that they may reveal cognitively and psychologically important details of language in use. investigating spoken data in natural context makes it possible for us to explore issues beyond the scope offered by the traditional syntactic studies. for example, linguistic

research in information retrieval is enjoying renewed interest by many different communities. commercial retrieval systems, which in the past have concentrated on boolean pat tern matching methodologies, are beginning to look into more sophist icated search methods, including complex stat istical and /o r natural language processing systems. this has spurred new interest in research in information retrieval in this community and also in the academic communities. technology is being addit ionally pushed by the current emphasis on electronic communication, including digital libraries and the interlinking of oflices to allow ofrice automation. the availability of electronic text records in huge (and exponentially-growing) quantities, and the rapidly-expanding internet access by potent ial users, is a third factor in promoting research. arpa has contr ibuted to this increased interest by sponsoring a new test collection for information retrieval. the widespread availability of the t i p s t e r collection has allowed research on large-scale, real-world retrieval problems. this has not only opened up new areas of research tha t were not discovered using the smmler test collections, but has provided proof tha t the more complex retrieval systems do indeed scale up to handle realistic text collections. the first paper in this session, "overview of the second text retrieval conference (trec-2) ' , by donna harman, i l lustrates the use of this collection in a massive crosssystem evaluation. the trec-2 conference, held in august of 1993, compared results from 31 different retrieval systems working with the t i p s t e r collection. these systems used many different approaches to retrieval, including manually constructed patterns, automatical ly constructed stat is t ical queries that were input to stat ist ical retrieval systems, and natural language approaches to information retrieval. the paper discusses the t i p s t e r test collection, the evaluation methods used in trec, and the results from the conference. the next two papers in the session represent systems that appeared in treg-2. the first of these papers discusses a mostly stat is t ical system and the second of these papers discusses a system using natural language processing techniques. the paper "learning from relevant documents in large scale routing retrieval", by k.l. kwok and l. grunfeld, discusses experiments performed using a routing or filtering paradigm. this type of information retrieval assumes that users have a s tanding request for information, such as in an electronic dissemination service or an intelligence operation. there exists training information in the form of previously-seen documents considered relevant, and this training information is used to produce bet ter queries. this paper discusses in detail the problems of learning from fulltext relevant documents, which range in length from a short paragraph to many hundreds of pages. this problem is compounded by the availabili ty of large numbers of such relevant documents. many experiments were performed to discover the opt imal method of selecting which (and what parts) of documents to use for training, and the results are given in the paper. the next paper, "document representat ion in natural language text retrieval", by tomek strzalkowski, discusses experiments performed using mostly the adhoc retrieval paradigm. in this case the documents are known in advance, but the information is requested on an "adhoc" basis. there is no training data , and systems are often required to deal with short user requests that might not map well onto the terminology used in the documents. one way around this problem is to automatical ly transform the user query into a linguistic s tructure that is expanded to bet ter map into the document collection. this paper presents a series of experiments in automatical ly locating useful lingulstic fragments of documents to match against such a modified user query. one of the main issues dealt with here is the correct term weighting for these fragments. information retrieval is not l imited to the matching of textual material; two of the papers in the session deal with speech retrieval systems. the first of these papers describes a modification of t radi t ional information retrieval methods to handle speech, whereas the second paper uses t radi t ional speech recognition technology with information retrieval as the application. the paper, "assessing the retrieval effectiveness of a speech retrieval system by simulating recognition errors", by peter schauble and ulrike glavltsch, deals with retrieval of speech (speech "documents"). their retrieval system uses phonetically motivated subword units as opposed to complete words for indexing of speech. the use of subwords as index terms means tha t the system can be used against either speech or text, and that techniques tradit ionally used in text retrieval can be modified for use with speech. the production of these subwords is dependent on current speech recognition technology, which is known to be error-prone. this paper presents some experiments using simulated speech recognition errors against well-known information retrieval test collections (textual) to see what effects these errors have on retrieval performance. the second of these papers, "speech-based retrieval using semantic co-occurrence fil tering", by julian kupiec, don kimber, and vijay balasubramanian, uses a s tandard hidden markov model as input to a text retrieval system. the issue in this paper is how to deal with the very large (generally unrestricted) vocabulary size that is normal for most text retrieval applications. speech input using large vocabularies (and possibly many different speakers) is likely

natural language processing (nlp) is poised to substantially influence the world. however, significant progress comes hand-in-hand with substantial risks. addressing them requires broad engagement with various fields of study. yet, little empirical work examines the state of such engagement (past or current). in this paper, we quantify the degree of influence between 23 fields of study and nlp (on each other). we analyzed ~77k nlp papers, ~3.1m citations from nlp papers to other papers, and ~1.8m citations from other papers to nlp papers. we show that, unlike most fields, the cross-field engagement of nlp, measured by our proposed citation field diversity index (cfdi), has declined from 0.58 in 1980 to 0.31 in 2022 (an all-time low). in addition, we find that nlp has grown more insular -- citing increasingly more nlp papers and having fewer papers that act as bridges between fields. nlp citations are dominated by computer science; less than 8% of nlp citations are to linguistics, and less than 3% are to math and psychology. these findings underscore nlp's urgent need to reflect on its engagement with various fields.

neural architecture search (nas) is a promising and rapidly evolving research area. training a large number of neural networks requires an exceptional amount of computational power, which makes nas unreachable for those researchers who have limited or no access to high-performance clusters and supercomputers. a few benchmarks with precomputed neural architectures performances have been recently introduced to overcome this problem and ensure reproducible experiments. however, these benchmarks are only for the computer vision domain and, thus, are built from the image datasets and convolution-derived architectures. in this work, we step outside the computer vision domain by leveraging the language modeling task, which is the core of natural language processing (nlp). our main contribution is as follows: we have provided search space of recurrent neural networks on the text datasets and trained 14k architectures within it; we have conducted both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of the trained models using datasets for semantic relatedness and language understanding evaluation; finally, we have tested several nas algorithms to demonstrate how the precomputed results can be utilized. we consider that the benchmark will provide more reliable empirical findings in the community and stimulate progress in developing new nas methods well suited for recurrent architectures.

the information retrieval (ir) process starts with the query entered by the user in the system. the ir system is mostly used in the search string in text utilities and web search engines. for ir algorithms to efficiently retrieve pertinent documents, the documents are usually converted into an appropriate representation. query expansion and natural language processing (nlp) are the most researched fields in artificial intelligence (ai). the query expansion process provides the additional information that is understood by the user in their query. this research study explores several nlp query expansion techniques that utilize word embedding methods for autonomous query expansion including deep learning, machine learning, and ontology approach. this research also discusses the importance of query expansion to improve search efficacy and provides a coherent view of nlp-based query expansion methods that leverage a range of data sources and methodologies.

abstract purpose learner development and promotion rely heavily on narrative assessment comments, but narrative assessment quality is rarely evaluated in medical education. educators have developed tools such as the quality of assessment for learning (qual) tool to evaluate the quality of narrative assessment comments; however, scoring the comments generated in medical education assessment programs is time intensive. the authors developed a natural language processing (nlp) model for applying the qual score to narrative supervisor comments. method samples of 2,500 entrustable professional activities assessments were randomly extracted and deidentified from the mcmaster (1,250 comments) and saskatchewan (1,250 comments) emergency medicine (em) residency training programs during the 2019–2020 academic year. comments were rated using the qual score by 25 em faculty members and 25 em residents. the results were used to develop and test an nlp model to predict the overall qual score and qual subscores. results all 50 raters completed the rating exercise. approximately 50% of the comments had perfect agreement on the qual score, with the remaining resolved by the study authors. creating a meaningful suggestion for improvement was the key differentiator between high- and moderate-quality feedback. the overall qual model predicted the exact human-rated score or 1 point above or below it in 87% of instances. overall model performance was excellent, especially regarding the subtasks on suggestions for improvement and the link between resident performance and improvement suggestions, which achieved 85% and 82% balanced accuracies, respectively. conclusions this model could save considerable time for programs that want to rate the quality of supervisor comments, with the potential to automatically score a large volume of comments. this model could be used to provide faculty with real-time feedback or as a tool to quantify and track the quality of assessment comments at faculty, rotation, program, or institution levels.

search engines (google search, bing search, etc.) have had great success over the past decade, promoting productivity in almost every area. based on user inputs, search engines are able to present users with lists of related contents (links) and previews. more recently, high-level human-like responses combining various searched contents are being made possible due to recent advancements in large language models (llm). however, oftentimes, users still find it still hard to quickly navigate to the contents they really look for and demand a better searching framework. for example, some users might waste time skimming through lots of technical details when they just hope to have an overview. we examine this user demand and believe a complexity-aware pipeline could greatly help with this inconvenience. more specifically, we propose a searching paradigm that analyzes results from standard search engines by their complexities first, and then present users with complexity-labeled contents through a new user interface design. through this new searching paradigm, we aim to present users with more customized search results sorted by their complexity labels with consideration to user intent, whether that would be a high-level overview or a detailed technical inspection. this is done through utilizing state-of-the-art transformer models fine-tuned on our custom-made dataset and modified for our intent.

natural language processing (nlp) is a promising tool for collecting data that are usually hard to obtain during extreme weather, like community response and infrastructure performance. patterns and trends in abundant data sources such as weather reports, news articles, and social media may provide insights into potential impacts and early warnings of impending disasters. this paper reviews the peer-reviewed studies (journals and conference proceedings) that used nlp to assess extreme weather events, focusing on heavy rainfall events. the methodology searches four databases (sciencedirect, web of science, scopus, and ieee xplore) for articles published in english before june 2022. the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis reviews and meta-analysis guidelines were followed to select and refine the search. the method led to the identification of thirty-five studies. in this study, hurricanes, typhoons, and flooding were considered. nlp models were implemented in information extraction, topic modeling, clustering, and classification. the findings show that nlp remains underutilized in studying extreme weather events. the review demonstrated that nlp could potentially improve the usefulness of social media platforms, newspapers, and other data sources that could improve weather event assessment. in addition, nlp could generate new information that should complement data from ground-based sensors, reducing monitoring costs. key outcomes of nlp use include improved accuracy, increased public safety, improved data collection, and enhanced decision-making are identified in the study. on the other hand, researchers must overcome data inadequacy, inaccessibility, nonrepresentative and immature nlp approaches, and computing skill requirements to use nlp properly.
