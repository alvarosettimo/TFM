Nursing homes (NHs) using the Preferences for Everyday Living Inventory (PELI-NH) to assess important preferences and provide person-centered care find the number of items (72) to be a barrier to using the assessment.;;;;;;
;;;;;;
;;;;;;
Research Design and Methods;;;;;;
"Using a sample of n = 255 NH resident responses to the PELI-NH, we used the 16 preference items from the MDS 3.0 Section F to develop a machine learning recommender system to identify additional PELI-NH items that may be important to specific residents. Much like the Netflix recommender system, our system is based on the concept of collaborative filtering whereby insights and predictions (e.g., filters) are created using the interests and preferences of many users. The algorithm identifies multiple sets of """"you might also like"""" patterns called association rules, based upon responses to the 16 MDS preferences that recommends an additional set of preferences with a high likelihood of being important to a specific resident.";;;;;;
;;;;;;
;;;;;;
Results;;;;;;
In the evaluation of the combined apriori and logistic regression approach, we obtained a high recall performance (i.e., the ratio of correctly predicted preferences compared with all predicted preferences and nonpreferences) and high precision (i.e., the ratio of correctly predicted rules with respect to the rules predicted to be true) of 80.2% and 79.2%, respectively.;;;;;;
;;;;;;
;;;;;;
Discussion and Implications;;;;;;
"The recommender system successfully provides guidance on how to best tailor the preference items asked of residents and can support preference capture in busy clinical environments, contributing to the feasibility of delivering person-centered care."",2019,""{'url': 'https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article-pdf/59/1/167/27456534/gny056.pdf', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1093/geront/gny056?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1093/geront/gny056, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The restaurant industry in Riyadh has experienced rapid growth in recent years, making it increasingly challenging for customers to choose from the large number of restaurants available. This paper proposes a matrix factorization collaborative-based recommender system for Riyadh city restaurants. The system leverages user reviews and ratings to predict users’ preferences and recommend restaurants likely to be of interest to them. The system incorporates three different approaches, namely, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), singular value decomposition (SVD), and optimized singular value decomposition (SVD++). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first recommender system specifically designed for Riyadh restaurants. A comprehensive dataset of restaurants in Riyadh was collected, scraped from Foursquare.com, which includes a wide range of restaurant features and attributes. The dataset is publicly available, enabling other researchers to replicate the experiments and build upon the work. The performance of the system was evaluated using a real-world dataset, and its effectiveness was demonstrated by comparing it to a state-of-the-art recommender system. The evaluation results showed that SVD and NMF are effective methods for generating recommendations, with SVD performing slightly better in terms of RMSE and NMF performing slightly better in terms of MAE. Overall, the findings suggest that the collaborative-based approach using matrix factorization algorithms is an effective way to capture the complex relationships between users and restaurants."",2023,""{'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/17/9574/pdf?version=1692870311', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.3390/app13179574?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.3390/app13179574, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

With the advancement in the sub-domain of machine learning i.e., deep learning, multiple problems are minutely solved in agricultural sector. This paper focuses on recommending 22 types of crops with the aid of correlation analysis, distribution analysis, ensembling, and majority voting. A three-tiered framework is proposed in order to implement the crop recommendation problem. It includes data preprocessing, classification, and performance evaluation modules. The feature analysis is done through correlation plots and density distribution followed by classification using ensembling techniques. Finally, performance evaluation is performed using majority voting technique. This article further uses ensembling with base learners i.e., decision trees, random forest, Naïve Bayes, and support vector machines using majority voting. Further, majority voting is used to decide the final performance metrics. The practical visualization of the correlation plot, density-histogram distribution plots, confusion matrices, and performance plot are presented. The accuracy achieved post implementation is 99.54& by using Naïve Bayes classifier. The majority voting ensembler has not shown much accuracy i.e., 98.52&. Thus, Naïve Bayes classifier is proved to be the best fit for this problem statement.

The agriculture sector is also a significant contributor factor to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Blessing to the country is the overwhelming size of the agricultural sector. However, regrettable is the yield per hectare of crops in comparison to international standards. This is one of the possible causes for a higher suicide rate among marginal farmers in India. This paper proposes a viable and user-friendly yield prediction system for the farmers. The proposed system provides connectivity to farmers via a mobile application. GPS helps to identify the user location. The user provides the area & soil type as input. Machine learning algorithms allow choosing the most profitable crop list or predicting the crop yield for a user-selected crop. To predict the crop yield, selected Machine Learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR), and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) are used.

Currently, many e-commerce platforms use a text-based product search, which has limitations to fetch the most similar products. An image-based similarity search for recommendations had considerable gains in popularity for many areas, especially for the e-commerce platforms giving a better visual search experience by the users. In our research work, we proposed a machine-learning-based approach for a similar image-based recommender system. We applied a dimensionality reduction technique using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) through Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for transforming the extracted features into lower-dimensional space. Further, we applied the K-Means++ clustering approach for the possible cluster identification for a similar group of products. Later, we computed the Manhattan distance measure for the input image to the target clusters set for fetching the top-N similar products with low distance measure. We compared our approach with five different unsupervised clustering algorithms, namely Minibatch, K-Mediod, Agglomerative, Brich, and the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and used the 40,000 fashion product image dataset from the Kaggle web platform for the product recommendation process. We computed various cluster performance metrics on K-means++ and achieved a Silhouette Coefficient (SC) of 0.1414, a Calinski-Harabasz (CH) index score of 669.4, and a Davies–Bouldin (DB) index score of 1.8538.

The study aimed at tackling the wrong placement of applicants into courses and to also address the wastage of admission vacancies by recommending the appropriate course(s). About 8,700 data for three academic sessions were collected from two different universities for training and testing the system. The features used are the results of Senior Secondary School subjects and the average score of UTME and Post-UTME. The proposed system employed five (5) classification models, which include Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor and Decision Tree Algorithm. The Linear Regression Model has the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as 2. 614 $e^{-14}$ The other four (4) classification models are also found to be efficient with an efficiency of at least 90% sequel to the dimensionality reduction in the dataset. The result shows that both Naive Bayes Classifier and Support Vector Machine have achieved the highest recommendation accuracy of approximately 99.94%, which outperformed Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms with an accuracy of 98.10% and 99.87% respectively. The system can be adjusted with the change of admission criteria in Nigerian Universities. In consideration of the high degree of prediction accuracy, flexibility is an advantage, as the system can predict suitable courses that match the students’ grades.

Collaborative filtering and content-based recommender systems have already been in use by the industry for recommending things, such as movies, news, restaurants, and shopping items to the users, and however, no one has utilized these off-the-shelf models for enhancing the student experience and improving the quality of higher education in academia. This paper presents a case study showcasing the use of probabilistic topic models for generating recommendations to users in academia through appropriate course allocation and supervisor assignment. The proposed system coined as ScholarLite harnesses the power of machine learning to extract research themes from faculty members’ past publications, mines research interests from their resumes, and combines it with their educational background to generate recommendations for course teaching, research supervision, and industry–academia collaboration. We have shown the recommendation results on real-world data gathered from the higher education commission of the country and demonstrated that the proposed techniques are scalable across various programs offered by the universities and could be deployed in a small budget by universities for automating course and supervisor allocation procedures. The experiments confirm our performance expectation by showing good relevance and objectivity in results, thus making this decision management system more appealing for large-scale deployment and use by academia."",2019,""{'url': 'https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8600701/08693719.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2912012?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2912012, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

First, the data is collected from Twitter and cleaned by subsequent data cleaning processes. Then, this pre-processed data is fed into the LightDL model, which learns the important features like hashtags, unigrams, multigrams, etc. from each piece of data. Here, we have learned about four groups of features, including semantic features, syntactic features, symbolic features, and tweet-based features. Finally, the data is classified into positive, negative, and neutral categories according to the learned features. On the basis of classified sentiment, the review is generated to the users. Finally, the model is evaluated in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, f-measure, and error rate through extensive experiments in Matlab.

Recommender systems deploy machine learning models to learn users’ preferences from collected historical data, leading to more centralized recommendation results due to the feedback loop. As a result, it will harm the ranking of content outside the narrowed scope and limit the options seen by users. In this work, we first conduct data analysis from a graph view to observe that the users’ feedback is restricted to limited items, verifying the phenomenon of centralized recommendation. We further develop a general simulation framework to derive the procedure of the recommender system, including data collection, model learning, and item exposure, which forms a loop. To address the filter bubble issue under the feedback loop, we then propose a general and easy-to-use reinforcement learning-based method, which can adaptively select few but effective connections between nodes from different communities as the exposure list. We conduct extensive experiments in the simulation framework based on large-scale real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that our proposed reinforcement learning-based control method can serve as an effective solution to alleviate the filter bubble and the separated communities induced by it.

Unfortunately, the number of ratings is extremely sparse. Generating rating prediction is a major issue in the recommender system research field. The most popular model using latent factor or matrix factorization to generate rating prediction faced the problem in accuracy performance. This research aimed to develop a novel model to generate rating prediction using two deep learning variants based on Stack Denoising Auto Encoder (SDAE), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and combining with a latent factor model based on Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF). This study considered integrated information resources, including user information and document product information. Following the experiment report involved in Movielens and Amazon Information Video dataset, our model outperformed previous works using PMF, Collaborative Deep Learning (CDL), Probabilistic Hybrid Deep Learning (PHD) and LSTM-PMF model, with more than 5% in average using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) evaluation metrices."",2022,""{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.22266/ijies2022.0430.35', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.22266/ijies2022.0430.35?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.22266/ijies2022.0430.35, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Even though it looks challenging, such an issue can be controlled if we can reuse them. To handle this, in our work, we design a machine learning and blockchain-oriented system that identifies the waste objects/products and recommends to the user multiple ‘Do-It-Yourself’ (DIY) ideas to reuse or recycle. Blockchain records every transaction in the shared ledger to enable transaction verifiability and supports better decision-making. In this study, a Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained on about 11700 images is developed using ResNet50 architecture for object recognition (training accuracy of 94%). We deploy several smart contracts in the Hyperledger Fabric (HF) blockchain platform to validate recommended DIY ideas by blockchain network members. HF is a decentralized ledger technology platform that executes the deployed smart contracts in a secured Docker container to initialize and manage the ledger state. The complete model is delivered on a web platform using Flask, where our recommendation system works on a web scraping script written using Python. Fetching DIY ideas using web-scraping takes nearly 1 second on a desktop machine with an Intel Core-i7 processor with 8 cores, 16 GB RAM, installed with Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit operating system, and Python 3.6 package. Further, we evaluate blockchain-based smart contracts’ latencies and throughput performances using the hyperledger caliper benchmark.

These are performed by expert technicians who must carefully analyze the network state and the flow of incoming alarms to decide how, where and when to take actions on the network. While based on implicit guiding principles, these network actions are very hard to automate with explicit rules due to the high complexity of the system";" hence NOC action is essentially a manual process today. To automate part of that process, in this paper we introduce an Action Recommendation Engine (ARE) that can learn implicit NOC action rules with supervised machine learning from historical data. As a result, ARE can recommend suitable action(s) to remedy network faults and engineer the traffic to minimize costs, all while maximizing the users’ Quality of Experience. To quantify the effectiveness of different NOC action scenarios, we introduce the QoE-OPEX metric which balances between users’ quality of Experience and ISP’s operational costs. After proper model training on 56,000 data points with 66 features, we demonstrate that ARE can effectively reproduce implicit action-taking logic of NOC technicians, thus moving us one step closer to reliable autonomous networks and fully-automated NOCs."",2021,""{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1109/tnsm.2021.3095463', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/tnsm.2021.3095463?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/tnsm.2021.3095463, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

"82921c5f3622cb54aba641e7e12f5bb0befe8764,Blockchain-Secured Recommender System for Special Need Patients Using Deep Learning,""Recommender systems offer several advantages to hospital data management units and patients with special needs. These systems are more dependent on the extreme subtle hospital-patient data. Thus, disregarding the confidentiality of patients with special needs is not an option. In recent times, several proposed techniques failed to cryptographically guarantee the data privacy of the patients with special needs in the diet recommender systems (RSs) deployment. In order to tackle this pitfall, this paper incorporates a blockchain privacy system (BPS) into deep learning for a diet recommendation system for patients with special needs. Our proposed technique allows patients to get notifications about recommended treatments and medications based on their personalized data without revealing their confidential information. Additionally, the paper implemented machine and deep learning algorithms such as RNN, Logistic Regression, MLP, etc., on an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) dataset acquired via the internet and hospitals that comprises the data of 50 patients with 13 features of various diseases and 1,000 products. The product section has a set of eight features. The IoMT data features were analyzed with BPS and further encoded prior to the application of deep and machine learning-based frameworks. The performance of the different machine and deep learning methods were carried out and the results verify that the long short-term memory (LSTM) technique is more effective than other schemes regarding prediction accuracy, precision, F1-measures, and recall in a secured blockchain privacy system. Results showed that 97.74% accuracy utilizing the LSTM deep learning model was attained. The precision of 98%, recall, and F1-measure of 99% each for the allowed class was also attained. For the disallowed class, the scores were 89, 73, and 80% for precision, recall, and F1-measure, respectively. The performance of our proposed BPS is subdivided into two categories: the secured communication channel of the recommendation system and an enhanced deep learning approach using health base medical dataset that spontaneously identifies what food a patient with special needs should have based on their disease and certain features including gender, weight, age, etc. The proposed system is outstanding as none of the earlier revised works of literature described a recommender system of this kind."",2021,""{'url': 'https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2021.737269/pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8488210, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Many machine learning algorithms are used to develop RSs. Choosing the best machine learning algorithm to provide users with a product or service is the most challenging task in the area of RSs. Now we are witnessing a paradigm shift in the purchase habits of people from in-shop to online resulting in the availability of online information exponentially growing every day. The ever-increasing online information and the number of online users create new avenues in RS. In an online shopping scenario, these systems must be able to recommend relevant items to the users. The RSs have to deal with the huge amount of information by filtering the relevant information based on the analysis made on the inputs made by the users during their online sessions. These systems can recommend appropriate items to users based on their interest and previous preference which can lead to increased sales. The three major techniques used to build a RS are content-based, collaborative based and hybrid-based.

In this work, we evaluate six recommendation algorithms from a user-centric perspective, collecting both objective user activity data and subjective user perceptions. In a field experiment involving 1508 users who participated for at least a month, we compare six algorithms built using machine learning techniques, ranging from supervised matrix factorization, contextual bandit learning to Q learning. We found that the objective design in machine-learning-based recommender systems significantly affects user experience. Specifically, a recommender optimizing for implicit action prediction error engages users more than optimizing for explicit rating prediction error when modeled with the classical matrix factorization algorithms, which empirically explains the historical transition of recommender system research from modeling explicit feedback data to implicit feedback data. However, the action-based recommender is not as precise as the rating-based recommender in that it increases not only positive engagement but also negative engagement, e.g., negative action rate and user browsing effort which are negatively correlated with user satisfaction. We show that blending both explicit and implicit feedback from users through an online learning algorithm can gain the benefits of engagement and mitigate one of the possible costs (i.e., the increased browsing effort)."",2018,""{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1145/3167132.3167275?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1145/3167132.3167275, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The data mining field has become a forum where it is necessary to utilize users' interactions, decision-making processes and overall experience. Nowadays, e-learning is indeed a progressive method to provide online education in long-lasting terms, contrasting to the customary head-to-head process of educating with culture. Through e-learning, an ever-increasing number of learners have profited from different programs. Notwithstanding, the highly assorted variety of the students on the internet presents new difficulties to the conservative one-estimate fit-all learning systems, in which a solitary arrangement of learning assets is specified to the learners. The problems and limitations in well-known recommender systems are much variations in the expected absolute error, consuming more query processing time, and providing less accuracy in the final recommendation. The main objectives of this research are the design and analysis of a new transductive support vector machine-based hybrid personalized hybrid recommender for the machine learning public data sets. The learning experience has been achieved through the habits of the learners. This research designs some of the new strategies that are experimented with to improve the performance of a hybrid recommender. The modified one-source denoising approach is designed to preprocess the learner dataset. The modified anarchic society optimization strategy is designed to improve the performance measurements. The enhanced and generalized sequential pattern strategy is proposed to mine the sequential pattern of learners. The enhanced transductive support vector machine is developed to evaluate the extracted habits and interests. These new strategies analyze the confidential rate of learners and provide the best recommendation to the learners. The proposed generalized model is simulated on public datasets for machine learning such as movies, music, books, food, merchandise, healthcare, dating, scholarly paper, and open university learning recommendation. The experimental analysis concludes that the enhanced clustering strategy discovers clusters that are based on random size. The proposed recommendation strategies achieve better significant performance over the methods in terms of expected absolute error, accuracy, ranking score, recall, and precision measurements. The accuracy of the proposed datasets lies between 82 and 98%. The MAE metric lies between 5 and 19.2% for the simulated public datasets.

"4558d4eb033dffcf7a260ea63f5ef6809603dffd,FedDyn: A dynamic and efficient federated distillation approach on Recommender System,""Federated Learning (FL) is a popular distributed machine learning paradigm that enables devices to work together to train a centralized model without transmitting raw data. However, when the model becomes complex, mobile devices’ communication overhead can be unacceptably large in traditional FL methods. To address this problem, Federated Distillation (FD) is proposed as a federated version of knowledge distillation. Most of the recent FD methods calculate the model output (logits) of each client as the local knowledge on a public proxy dataset and do distillation with the average of the clients’ logits on the server side. Nevertheless, these FD methods are not robust and perform poorly in the non-IID (data is nonindependent and non-identically distributed) scenario such as Federated Recommendation (FR). In order to eliminate the non-IID problem and apply FD in FR, we proposed a novel method named FedDyn to construct a proxy dataset and extract local knowledge dynamically in this paper. In this method, we replaced the average strategy with focus distillation to strengthen reliable knowledge, which solved the non-IID problem that the local model has biased knowledge. The average strategy is a dilution and perturbation of knowledge since it treats reliable and unreliable knowledge equally important. In addition, to prevent inference of private user information from local knowledge, we used a method like local differential privacy techniques to protect this knowledge on the client side. The experimental results showed that our method has a faster convergence speed and lower communication overhead than the baselines on three datasets, including MovieLens-10OK, MovieLens-IM and Pinterest."",2023,""{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICPADS56603.2022.00107?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPADS56603.2022.00107, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, a lack of teaching materials and human resources presents a major challenge to meeting the growing demand for programming education. One way to compensate for a shortage of trained teachers is to use machine learning techniques to assist learners. Therefore, we propose a learning path recommendation system based on a learner’s ability charts by means of a recurrent neural network. In brief, a learning path is constructed from a learner’s submission history with a trial-and-error process, and the learner’s ability chart is used as a barometer of their current knowledge.

However, user behavior data is observational rather than experimental. This makes various biases widely exist in the data, including but not limited to selection bias, position bias, exposure bias, and popularity bias. Blindly fitting the data without considering the inherent biases will result in many serious issues, e.g., the discrepancy between offline evaluation and online metrics, hurting user satisfaction and trust on the recommendation service, and so on. To transform the large volume of research models into practical improvements, it is highly urgent to explore the impacts of the biases and perform debiasing when necessary. When reviewing the papers that consider biases in RS, we find that, to our surprise, the studies are rather fragmented and lack a systematic organization. The terminology “bias” is widely used in the literature, but its definition is usually vague and even inconsistent across papers. This motivates us to provide a systematic survey of existing work on RS biases. In this paper, we first summarize seven types of biases in recommendation, along with their definitions and characteristics. We then provide a taxonomy to position and organize the existing work on recommendation debiasing. Finally, we identify some open challenges and envision some future directions, with the hope of inspiring more research work on this important yet less investigated topic.

But most of the time the average rating isn't enough to predict the quality or hygiene of the restaurant. Different people have different perspectives and priorities when evaluating a restaurant. Many online businesses now have implemented personalized recommendation systems which basically try to identify user preferences and then provide relevant products to enhance the users experience . In turn, users will be able to enjoy exploring what they might like with convenience and ease because of the recommendation results. Finding an ideal restaurant can be a struggle because the mainstream recommender apps have not yet adopted the personalized recommender approach. So we took up this challenge and we aim to build the prototype of a personalized recommender system that incorporates metadata which is basically the information provided by interactions of customers and restaurants online(reviews), which gives a pretty good idea of customers satisfaction and taste as well as features of the restaurant. This type of approach enhances user experience of finding a restaurant that suits their taste better. This paper has used a package called lightfm(the library of python for implementing popular recommendation algorithms) and the dataset from yelp. There are different methods of filtering the data, here we have used Hybrid filtering which is a combination of Content-based filtering (CBF) and Collaborative Filtering (CF).

But the recommendations from these systems do not change on inputs beyond user and item profile and transaction data. There have been some attempts in the past to optimize on more varied data in recommenders, example of which is the location based recommenders. But location is just one dimension of the state that a user could have shared with GPS/GLONASS/BaiDeu sensor available in most Smartphones. With an upcoming era of Smart-wears and pervasive IoTs, there are a lot many other dimensions of a user state which can be utilized to optimize upon the concept of Optimal State Recommender Solutions. This paper suggests upgrading from conventional recommendations that are based on user/ item preferences alone with systems that provide the best recommendation at the most optimal state when the user is most receptive to accept the recommendation, the “optimal state recommendation solution” and proposes solutions and architectures to overcome the challenges of dealing with real time, distributed machine learning on IoT scale data in implementing this solution. The paper leverages some of the advance distributed machine learning algorithms like variants of Distributed Kalman Filters, Distributed Alternating Least Square Recommenders, Distributed Mini-Batch Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) based Classifiers, and highly scalable distributed computation and machine learning platforms like Apache Spark, (Apache) Spark MLlib, Spark Streaming, Python/PySpark, R/SparkR, Apache Kafka in an high performance, distributed, fault tolerant architecture.

Studies have shown that employees who find their job meaningful and satisfying are generally more productive and less likely to leave the job. Human Resource professionals therefore need to ensure that proper screening of candidates is conducted during the recruitment process and that they hire the best fit candidate for a job.

This paper presents the development of JobFit, a job recommendation system which makes use of a recommender system, machine learning techniques and past data to predict the best fit candidate for a job. The proposed job recommendation system takes as input the requirement of a job and the profile of the applicants and outputs a JobFit score indicating how fit each applicant is for the particular job. The system ultimately provides the HR professionals with a sorted list of all candidates with those who are more fit and apt for the job recommended first.

"15bc5ab9de23416c375eb7b16aa9a1a3e383490a,e-Commerce Personalized Recommendation Based on Machine Learning Technology,""As e-commerce offers more and more choices for users, its structure becomes more and more complicated. Inevitably, it brings about the problem of information overload. The solution to this problem is an e-commerce personalized recommendation system using machine learning technology. People often seem confused when facing extensive information and cannot grasp the key points. This paper studies the personalized recommendation technology of e-commerce: deeply analyzes the related technologies and algorithms of the e-commerce recommendation system and proposes the latest architecture of the e-commerce recommendation system according to the current development status of the e-commerce recommendation system. The system recommends accuracy and real-time requirements and divides the system into two parts: offline mining and online recommendation and analyzes and implements the functions and technologies of each part. User-based recommender systems, collaborative filtering recommender systems, and content-based recommender systems are analyzed, respectively. The personalized recommendation cannot only quickly help customers find the required commodity information in a wide range of complex information but also can compare more commodity information to help customers to judge. However, the existing recommendation system has some problems such as the lack of recommendation personality, the reduced relevance of recommendation, and the poor timeliness of recommendation. Finally, a recommendation system that combines three recommendation algorithms is designed, and experiments are carried out. The newly designed recommendation system is compared with three different recommendation systems, and a summary and outlook are made. Based on the introduction of the relevant theories, characteristics, and mainstream technologies of personalized recommendation based on machine learning, this document presents a constructive example of a model based on the factors that influence personalized e-commerce information recommendations in the retail sector. Through questionnaire surveys, we analyze and design the influencing factors for consumers to purchase personalized products after the survey and build a project using state-of-the-art field learning techniques. Through the model to test the eight hypotheses proposed in this paper, the results show that customer income level, customer online shopping experience, commodity prices, product quality, recommendation relevance, credit evaluation, and service quality will have a significant positive impact on shopping willingness and ultimately affect the customer’s shopping behavior. e-commerce platform can use this influencing factor to establish personalized information recommendation service mode."",2022,""{'url': 'https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/misy/2022/1761579.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1155/2022/1761579?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/1761579, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In this paper, we propose NEMO, a recommender system based on an Encoder-Decoder neural network to assist modelers in performing model editing operations. NEMO learns from past modeling activities and performs predictions employing a deep learning technique. Such an algorithm has been successfully applied in machine translation to convert a text from a language to another foreign language and vice versa. An empirical evaluation on a dataset of BPMN change-based persistent model demonstrates that the technique permits learning from existing operations and effectively predicting the next editing operations with considerably high prediction accuracy.

In particular, among all the stored actions and behaviors, there is information on the in-game purchases of virtual products. Such information is of critical importance in modern free-to-play titles, where gamers can select or buy a profusion of items during the game in order to progress and fully enjoy their experience. To try to maximize these kind of purchases, one can use a recommendation system so as to present players with items that might be interesting for them. Such systems can better achieve their goal by employing machine learning algorithms that are able to predict the rating of an item or product by a particular user. In this paper we evaluate and compare two of these algorithms, an ensemble-based model (extremely randomized trees) and a deep neural network, both of which are promising candidates for operational video-game recommender engines. Item recommenders can help developers improve the game. But, more importantly, it should be possible to integrate them into the game, so that users automatically get personalized recommendations while playing.

Accurately capturing users' profile is the key of recommendation. Recently, lots of researches on user profile extraction have been launched, including content-based recommendation. To better capture users' profiles, a three-step profiling method is adopted in this work. (1) Purchase item prediction is made based on Logistic Regression. (2) Purchase category prediction is made based on support vector machine (SVM), and (3) User's rating prediction is made based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). This work outperformed the baseline model on the user dataset collected from Amazon. So, in conclusion, the work has the ability of giving reasonable recommendation for users who would like to purchase online.

 ;;;;;;
 Learning materials are increasingly available on the Web making them an excellent source of information for building e-Learning recommendation systems. However, learners often have difficulty finding the right materials to support their learning goals because they lack sufficient domain knowledge to craft effective queries that convey what they wish to learn. The unfamiliar vocabulary often used by domain experts creates a semantic gap between learners and experts, and also makes it difficult to map a learner's query to relevant learning materials. We build an e-Learning recommender system that uses background knowledge extracted from a collection of teaching materials and encyclopedia sources to support the refinement of learners' queries. Our approach allows us to bridge the gap between learners and teaching experts. We evaluate our method using a collection of realistic learner queries and a dataset of Machine Learning and Data Mining documents. Evaluation results show our method to outperform benchmark approaches and demonstrates its effectiveness in assisting learners to find the right materials.;;;;;;

Recommendation from an analysis of sentiments seems to be a great challenge as user-generated content is represented using human language in several complicated ways. Many studies have focused on common fields such as reviews of electrical items, films, and restaurants, but not enough on health and medical issues. Sentiment analysis of healthcare in general and that of the drug experiences of individuals, in particular, may shed considerable light on how to focus on improving public health and reach the correct decision. In this paper, we design and implement a drug recommender system framework that applies sentiment analysis technologies on drug reviews. The objective of this research is to build a decision-making support platform to help patients to achieve more significant choices in drug selection. Firstly, we propose a sentimental measurement approach to drug reviews and generate ratings on drugs. Secondly, we take how much the drug reviews are useful to users, patient's conditions, and dictionary sentiment polarity of drug reviews into consideration. Then, we fuse those factors into the recommendation system to list appropriate medications. Experiments have been carried out using Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Linear Support Vector Classifier algorithm in rating generation and Hybrid model in recommendation based on the given open dataset. The analysis is carried out to tune the parameters for each algorithm in order to achieve greater performance.

Materials and Methods 43 physicians entered orders for 5 simulated clinical cases using a clinical order entry interface with or without access to a previously developed automated order recommender system. Cases were randomly allocated to the recommender system in a 3:2 ratio. A panel of clinicians scored whether the orders placed were clinically appropriate. Our primary outcome included the difference in clinical appropriateness scores. Secondary outcomes included total number of orders, case time, and survey responses. Results Clinical appropriateness scores per order were comparable for cases randomized to the order recommender system (mean difference -0.11 order per score, 95% CI: [-0.41, 0.20]). Physicians using the recommender placed more orders (median 16 vs 15 orders, incidence rate ratio 1.09, 95%CI: [1.01-1.17]). Case times were comparable with the recommender system. Order suggestions generated from the recommender system were more likely to match physician needs than standard manual search options. Physicians used recommender suggestions in 98% of available cases. Approximately 95% of participants agreed the system would be useful for their workflows. Discussion User testing with a simulated electronic medical record interface can assess the value of machine learning and clinical decision support tools for clinician usability and acceptance before live deployments. Conclusions Clinicians can use and accept machine learned clinical order recommendations integrated into an electronic order entry interface in a simulated setting.

Researchers have been attempting to improve their algorithms in order to issue better predictions to the users. However, one of the current challenges in the area refers to how to properly evaluate the predictions generated by a recommender system. In the extent of offline evaluations, some traditional concepts of evaluation have been explored, such as accuracy, Root Mean Square Error and P@N for top-k recommendations. In recent years, more research have proposed some new concepts such as novelty, diversity and serendipity. These concepts have been addressed with the goal to satisfy the users’ requirements. Numerous definitions and metrics have been proposed in previous work. On the absence of a specific summarization on evaluations of recommendation combining traditional metrics and recent progresses, this paper surveys and organizes the main research that present definitions about concepts and propose metrics or strategies to evaluate recommendations.

The medical field is one where much research is currently being conducted on recommender system utility. In the last few years, the amount of information available online that relates to healthcare has increased tremendously. Patients nowadays are more aware and look for answers to healthcare problems online. This has resulted in a dire need of an effective reliable online system to recommend the physician that is best suited to a particular patient in a limited time. In this article, a hybrid doctor-recommender system is proposed, by combining different recommendation approaches: content base, collaborative and demographic filtering to effectively tackle the issue of doctor recommendation. The proposed system addresses the issue of personalization through analysing patient's interest towards selecting a doctor. It uses a novel adoptive algorithm to construct a doctor's ranking function. Moreover, this ranking function is used to translate patients’ criteria for selecting a doctor into a numerical base rating, which will eventually be used in the recommendation of doctors. The system has been evaluated thoroughly, and result show that recommendations are reasonable and can fulfil patient's demand for reliable doctor's selection effectively."",2019,""{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1080/0144929X.2019.1625441?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2019.1625441, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Base on learners’ learning activities some interaction factors are extracted by using natural language process technologies and data mining automatically. Then, extracted interaction factors are utilized to generate some relationship indicators for inferring the learners’ directive relationship. These indicators are as symbols in order to describe a situation and relative degree which knowledge and understanding are socially distributed among group learners.

Integrating the recommender system effectively contributes to the prevention of disease, and it also leads to a reduction in treatment cost, which contributes to an improvement in the quality of life. At the same time, there exist various challenges within the recommender system, mainly cold start and scalability. To effectively address the inefficiencies, we propose combined hybrid methods in regard to machine learning. The primary aim of this learning method is to integrate the most effective and efficient learning algorithms to examine how combined hybrid filtering can help to improve the cold star problem efficiently in the provision of personalized well-being in regard to health food service. These methods include: (1) switching among content-based and collaborative filtering"; (2) identifying the user context with the integration of dynamic filtering;" and (3) learning the profiles with the help of processing and screening of reflecting feedback loops. The experimental results were evaluated by using three absolute error measures, providing comparable results with other studies relative to machine learning domains. The effects of using the hybrid learning method are gathered with the help of the experimental results.

Centralized job search engines provide a platform that connects directly employers with job-seekers. However, they require users to disclose a significant amount of personal data, i.e., build a user profile, in order to provide meaningful recommendations. In this paper, we present PrivateJobMatch - a privacy-oriented deferred multi-match recommender system - which generates stable pairings while requiring users to provide only a partial ranking of their preferences. PrivateJobMatch explores a series of adaptations of the game-theoretic Gale-Shapley deferred acceptance algorithm which combine the flexibility of decentralized markets with the intelligence of centralized matching. We identify the shortcomings of the original algorithm when applied to a job market and propose novel solutions that rely on machine learning techniques. Experimental results on real and synthetic data confirm the benefits of the proposed algorithms across several quality measures. Over the past year, we have implemented a PrivateJobMatch prototype and deployed it in an active job market economy. Using the gathered real-user preference data, we find that the match recommendations are superior to a typical decentralized job market---while requiring only a partial ranking of the user preferences."",2019,""{'url': 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3298689.3346983', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04564, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Search and recommender systems are probably the most prevalent ML powered application across the industry. They share most of the components composition and provide a user a ranked list of items, while there is subtle difference that a search system typically acts passively with a clear user intention in terms of queries and a recommender system acts more proactively. Deep learning has been wildly successful in solving complex tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, natural language processing and understanding, machine translation, etc. In the area of personalized recommender systems, deep learning has been showing tremendous impact in recent years. Search and recommender systems can be staged roughly in three phases: 1. User and query understanding, where a query or a user profile are processed so that the systems can use the processed information to 2. retrieve all the related items (high recall) and 3. rank the items by the order of the most relevance to the user's intent (high precision). Each phase has its unique challenges but deep learning has been ubiquitously pushing beyond the limit.

The application recommends to a tourist the best attractions in a particular place according to his preferences, his profile and his appreciation to previous visited places. This paper proposes a hybrid recommender system that combines the three most known recommender methods which are: the collaborative filtering (CF), the content-based filtering (CB) and the demographic filtering (DF). In order to implement these recommender methods, we have applied different machine learning algorithms which are the K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) for both CB and CF and the decision tree for the DF. The hybridization is a good choice to make the best of their advantages and to overcome the cold start problem. To enhance the recommendation accuracy, we use two hybridization techniques: switching and weighted. For the weighted approach, a novel linear programming model is applied to obtain the optimal weights' values. An extensive experimental study is conducted based on different evaluation metrics using extracted data from TripAdvisor. Our results show that the hybrid method is more accurate than the other recommender approaches used separately."",2017,""{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/AICCSA.2017.12?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/AICCSA.2017.12, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, it only covers a very small portion of possible inorganic crystals, which implies the presence of numerous currently unknown compounds. A powerful machine-learning strategy is mandatory to discover new inorganic compounds from all chemical combinations. Herein we propose a descriptor-based recommender-system approach to estimate the relevance of chemical compositions where crystals can be formed [i.e., chemically relevant compositions (CRCs)]. In addition to data-driven compositional similarity used in the literature, the use of compositional descriptors as a prior knowledge is helpful for the discovery of new compounds. We validate our recommender systems in two ways. First, one database is used to construct a model, while another is used for the validation. Second, we estimate the phase stability for compounds at expected CRCs using density functional theory calculations."",2017,""{'url': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.06387', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.06387, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

A hybrid web recommendation method is proposed by making use of the conceptual relationships among web resources to derive a novel model of the problem, enriched with semantic knowledge about the usage behavior. With our hybrid model for the web page recommendation problem we show the apt and flexibility of the reinforcement learning framework in the web recommendation domain, and demonstrate how it can be extended in order to incorporate various sources of information.

In recent years, the emotional analysis text has attracted academic scientists, and the professionals involved in the research, the use of research methods, and the cultural background related to language have become more and more extensive. In this paper, natural language processing is used to analyze emotions contained in translated texts. Natural language processing not only helps to manage the huge ability of data to efficiently translate text, but also helps to extract the hidden emotions in text translation. It only takes half the effort to achieve the multiplier effect. The multi label classification in natural language processing can reflect the information contained in emotion.

Despite the promise of NLP in the SDOH domain, the literature is dispersed across various disciplines, and there is a need to consolidate existing knowledge, identify knowledge gaps in the literature, and inform future research directions in this emerging field. Objective This research protocol describes a systematic review to identify and highlight NLP techniques, including large language models, used for SDOH-related studies. Methods A search strategy will be executed across PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, PsycINFO, HealthSource: Academic Nursing, and ACL Anthology to find studies published in English between 2014 and 2024. Three reviewers (SR, ZZ, and YC) will independently screen the studies to avoid voting bias, and two (AS and YX) additional reviewers will resolve any conflicts during the screening process. We will further screen studies that cited the included studies (forward search). Following the title abstract and full-text screening, the characteristics and main findings of the included studies and resources will be tabulated, visualized, and summarized. Results The search strategy was formulated and run across the 7 databases in August 2024. We expect the results to be submitted for peer review publication in early 2025. As of December 2024, the title and abstract screening was underway. Conclusions This systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive study of existing research on the application of NLP for various SDOH tasks across multiple textual datasets. By rigorously evaluating the methodologies, tools, and outcomes of eligible studies, the review will identify gaps in current knowledge and suggest directions for future research in the form of specific research questions. The findings will be instrumental in developing more effective NLP models for SDOH, ultimately contributing to improved health outcomes and a better understanding of social determinants in diverse populations.

Background: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmatic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a rare, life-threatening, systemic auto-immune disease. Due to the low prevalence and heterogenous registration, there is an urgent need to improve identification of AAV patients within the electronic health record (EHR)-system of health organizations to facilitate clinical research. Methods: Our aim was to identify, with a high sensitivity, low-prevalence AAV patients within large EHR-systems (>2.000.000 records) using an artificial intelligence (AI)-search tool. We combined a search on structured and unstructured data with natural language processing (NLP)-based exclusion. We developed the method in an academic center with an established AAV training set (n=203) and validated the method in a non-academic center with a validation set (n=84). We anonymously reviewed all identified patient records for AAV diagnosis. Results: The final search strategy combined four queries on disease description, laboratory measurements, medication and specialisms. In the training center, this search identified 608 patients, of which 346 were AAV patients upon manual review. 197/203 patients of the training set were retrieved, indicating a sensitivity of 97%. Employing NLP-based exclusion resulted in 444 patients with 339 AAV patients, resulting in an increase of positive predictive value (PPV) from 57% to 78% and a sensitivity of 96%. In the validation center the search strategy identified 333 patients, of which 194 were AAV patients, including 82/84 (98%) patients of the validation set. After NLP-based exclusion 223 patients remained, including 196 AAV patients, improving PPV from 58 to 86% with a sensitivity of 98%. Our identification method outperformed ICD-10 coding predominantly in identifying myeloperoxidase (MPO)-positive AAV patients and patients with few specialisms involved. Conclusions: We demonstrated excellent performance of an AI-based identification method, incorporating NLP, to identify AAV patients in EHRs and we validated the applicability and transportability. This method can accelerate research efforts, while avoiding the limitations of ICD-10-based registration."",2023,""{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1681/ASN.20233411S1102b?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.20233411S1102b, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

There is currently no published synthesis that relates specifically to the use of NLP methods for bipolar disorder, and this scoping review was conducted to synthesize valuable insights that have been presented in the literature. Objective This scoping review explored how NLP methods have been used in research to better understand bipolar disorder and identify opportunities for further use of these methods. Methods A systematic, computerized search of index and free-text terms related to bipolar disorder and NLP was conducted using 5 databases and 1 anthology: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Academic Search Ultimate, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, and the ACL Anthology. Results Of 507 identified studies, a total of 35 (6.9%) studies met the inclusion criteria. A narrative synthesis was used to describe the data, and the studies were grouped into four objectives: prediction and classification (n=25), characterization of the language of bipolar disorder (n=13), use of EHRs to measure health outcomes (n=3), and use of EHRs for phenotyping (n=2). Ethical considerations were reported in 60% (21/35) of the studies. Conclusions The current literature demonstrates how language analysis can be used to assist in and improve the provision of care for people living with bipolar disorder. Individuals with bipolar disorder and the medical community could benefit from research that uses NLP to investigate risk-taking, web-based services, social and occupational functioning, and the representation of gender in bipolar disorder populations on the web.

We developed and validated an NLP tool to identify discussions about prediabetes in EHR notes. Methods: We included adult patients without diabetes with an in-person office visit at any general medicine clinic at a single academic center and at least one HbA1c 5.7-6.4% between 7/1/2016 and 12/31/2018. In phase 1, we devised an initial keyword search strategy based on clinical experience. We extracted notes with at least one of the keywords and manually annotated them to determine whether they represented clinical discussions of prediabetes. We used the annotated notes to train and evaluate multiple machine learning and deep learning classifiers to replicate human annotation. In phase 2, we applied a similar annotation process and machine learning method on notes from a different group of clinic practices. We analyzed notes from phase 2 to describe the content of prediabetes discussions: labs ordered or reviewed (HbA1c or fasting glucose)"; lifestyle counseling; diabetes prevention program (DPP) discussion/referral; nutrition referral/discussion; and metformin discussion or ordering/continuation. Results: We identified 269 patients with prediabetes discussions in phase 2. Most commonly, PCPs provided lifestyle counseling (80%), reviewed current labs (63%) and ordered follow-up labs (60%). PCPs rarely discussed/referred to a nutritionist (4%). We did not find any discussions/referrals to a DPP. Metformin was discussed, ordered or continued in Conclusions: We developed and validated a NLP tool that identifies clinical discussions about prediabetes in the EHR. PCPs most commonly provided lifestyle counseling in the office and infrequently placed referrals to nutrition or DPPs, which have strong evidence for preventing progression to diabetes. Disclosure E.

"7a478258ad219ba07f7de83f175b0ac68fdcbe3b,Building a Natural Language Processing Tool to Identify Patients With High Clinical Suspicion for Kawasaki Disease from Emergency Department Notes.,""OBJECTIVE";;;;;;
Delayed diagnosis of Kawasaki disease (KD) may lead to serious cardiac complications. We sought to create and test the performance of a natural language processing (NLP) tool, the KD-NLP, in the identification of emergency department (ED) patients for whom the diagnosis of KD should be considered.;;;;;;
;;;;;;
;;;;;;
METHODS;;;;;;
We developed an NLP tool that recognizes the KD diagnostic criteria based on standard clinical terms and medical word usage using 22 pediatric ED notes augmented by Unified Medical Language System vocabulary. With high suspicion for KD defined as fever and three or more KD clinical signs, KD-NLP was applied to 253 ED notes from children ultimately diagnosed with either KD or another febrile illness. We evaluated KD-NLP performance against ED notes manually reviewed by clinicians and compared the results to a simple keyword search.;;;;;;
;;;;;;
;;;;;;
RESULTS;;;;;;
KD-NLP identified high-suspicion patients with a sensitivity of 93.6% and specificity of 77.5% compared to notes manually reviewed by clinicians. The tool outperformed a simple keyword search (sensitivity = 41.0%; specificity = 76.3%).;;;;;
;;;;;;
;;;;;;
CONCLUSIONS;;;;;;
"KD-NLP showed comparable performance to clinician manual chart review for identification of pediatric ED patients with a high suspicion for KD. This tool could be incorporated into the ED electronic health record system to alert providers to consider the diagnosis of KD. KD-NLP could serve as a model for decision support for other conditions in the ED."",2016,""{'url': 'https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/acem.12925', 'status': 'BRONZE', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1111/acem.12925?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.12925, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This study continues a series of studies on the effectiveness of scientific conferences. This topic has not been sufficiently investigated although it receives large funds, assuming that these conferences have added value for staff members' academic-professional development. Predicated on questionnaires filled by 96 academic staff members from 17 different departments, we found that when choosing conferences to attend, the type of faculty affect the search for cooperation. Moreover, staff members from the Faculty of Natural Sciences attribute more significance to conferences that result in publications than staff members from the Faculty of Health. The Faculty of Engineering creates negative mediation in the correlation between gender and cooperation. Namely, the Faculty of Engineering does not urge cooperation and even has a negative effect, but its effect is evident mainly among men. This finding complements prior research findings showing that women are more inclined to cooperation (Eckhaus & Davidovitch, 2018a). The current findings show that the inclination to cooperation is not related only to gender issues rather the faculty has an effect as well. The current findings might have a contribution to the significance of the faculty as an influential factor of conferences on cooperation – and in fact on the professional development of staff members."",2018,""{'url': 'https://www.economics-sociology.eu/files/11_317_Davidovitch.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.14254/2071-789X.2018/11-4/11?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.14254/2071-789X.2018/11-4/11, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

While dense retrieval has advanced various ad-hoc searches, it often struggles to match the underlying academic concepts between queries and documents, which is critical for paper search. To enable effective academic concept matching for paper search, we propose Taxonomy-guided Semantic Indexing (TaxoIndex) framework. TaxoIndex extracts key concepts from papers and organizes them as a semantic index guided by an academic taxonomy, and then leverages this index as foundational knowledge to identify academic concepts and link queries and documents. As a plug-and-play framework, TaxoIndex can be flexibly employed to enhance existing dense retrievers.

Information, in the most varied formats, is continuously added to the point of information overload. Consequently, the ability to navigate this ocean of data is crucial in our day-to-day lives, with familiar tools such as search engines carving a path through this unknown. In the research world, articles on a myriad of topics with distinct complexity levels are published daily, requiring specialized tools to facilitate the access and assessment of the information within. Recent endeavors in artificial intelligence, and in natural language processing in particular, can be seen as potential solutions for breaking information overload and provide enhanced search mechanisms by means of advanced algorithms. As the advent of transformer-based language models contributed to a more comprehensive analysis of both text-encoded intents and true document semantic meaning, there is simultaneously a need for additional computational resources. Information retrieval methods can act as low-complexity, yet reliable, filters to feed heavier algorithms, thus reducing computational requirements substantially. In this work, a new search engine is proposed, addressing machine reading at scale in the context of scientific and academic research. It combines state-of-the-art algorithms for information retrieval and reading comprehension tasks to extract meaningful answers from a corpus of scientific documents.

"eb00f7cc9678b2306ddbc208f997098ef89caf65,Harnessing Artificial Intelligence for Enhanced Efficiency in Academic Writing and Research,""In the recent past, there has been a surge in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the development of smart technologies for the purpose of improving efficiency in writing academic papers and conducting researches. However, the potential of using AI in the improvement of scholarly processes has not been optimally realized due to low awareness and visibility of the tool among the users. In this respect, this paper aims to describe the following tools of AI which can be applied in the research process including literature search and manuscript preparation. To assess the AI technology, the current literature in form of case studies was reviewed and this included the automated literature search engines, citation management software, natural language processing tools and data analysis tools. It also reveals that AI approaches can also help in decreasing the amount of time spent in article and data search, citation, citation management, and even in the generation of quality publications. This essay also examines the ethical issues of using artificial intelligence in research and any bias that may be present. In conclusion, it is necessary to underline that AI can be useful in improving the results of learning processes. But it is crucial that the researchers are trained well and are put in a position to doubt the outcome produced by the AI. Thus, the purpose of the paper is to discuss how AI is being used in academia at the moment and what could be done to expand its use in the future."",2024,""{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.54216/fpa.160209?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.54216/fpa.160209, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

This research aims to bring a new dimension to the analysis of academic content by identifying and classifying the underlying intentions of authors, a dimension not covered by traditional search systems. Our method, which enriches content with contextual classifications, transcends simple domain categorization by incorporating specific intention identifications such as proposing new methods, analyzing existing data, or presenting experimental results. To achieve this, we have implemented natural language processing models based on transformers, which have proven to be extremely effective for this task, offering high accuracy in intention classification.

However, NLP techniques are underrepresented in the analysis of Humanities and Social Science texts and in languages other than English. In particular, academic books are a highly valuable source of information that has not been exploited by these techniques at all. The recognition of named entities (person names, organizations or locations) and their semantic annotation over books could enrich the visibility and discoverability of the information by users. This is an opportunity for academia and the academic publishing industry in which semantic search is a central task and now books can be queried by named entities of interest that are in their content. This work proposes a methodology to apply named‐entity recognition to publish the results into an ontological semantic‐web format. The work has been performed over a corpus of academic books provided by UNE (Unión de Editoriales Universitarias Españolas, Union of Spanish University Presses).

This paper explores the potential of LLMs to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of retrieving bibliographic data from vast digital repositories. By leveraging the deep learning capabilities of LLMs, we propose a novel approach that surpasses traditional keyword-based search methods. Our methodology involves fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs on a comprehensive dataset of bibliographic records, enabling the model to understand and interpret complex queries more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves precision and recall metrics, thereby reducing the retrieval of irrelevant data and enhancing the overall user experience. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of these findings for academic research, library sciences, and digital archiving, highlighting the transformative potential of LLMs in organizing and accessing scholarly information.

EMERSE is now live at three academic medical centers, with additional sites currently working on implementation. In this report, we describe how EMERSE has been used to support cancer research based on a variety of metrics. METHODS We identified peer-reviewed publications that used EMERSE through online searches as well as through direct e-mails to users based on audit logs. These logs were also used to summarize use at each of the three sites. Search terms for two of the sites were characterized using the natural language processing tool MetaMap to determine to which semantic types the terms could be mapped. RESULTS We identified a total of 326 peer-reviewed publications that used EMERSE through August 2019, although this is likely an underestimation of the true total based on the use log analysis. Oncology-related research comprised nearly one third (n = 105";" 32.2%) of all research output. The use logs showed that EMERSE had been used by multiple people at each site (nearly 3,500 across all three) who had collectively logged into the system > 100,000 times. Many user-entered search queries could not be mapped to a semantic type, but the most common semantic type for terms that did match was “disease or syndrome,” followed by “pharmacologic substance.” CONCLUSION EMERSE has been shown to be a valuable tool for supporting cancer research. It has been successfully deployed at other sites, despite some implementation challenges unique to each deployment environment."",2020,""{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1200/cci.19.00134', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7265780, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

"4f77035a577d46ecc884150bdc3c3ffb0e04bb28,Utilization of Automated Keyword Search to Identify E-Scooter Injuries in the Emergency Department,""Background and objective Accurate identification and categorization of injuries from medical records can be challenging, yet it is important for injury epidemiology and prevention efforts. Coding systems such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) have well-known limitations. Utilizing computer-based techniques such as natural language processing (NLP) can help augment the identification and categorization of diseases in electronic health records. We used a Python program to search the text to identify cases of scooter injuries that presented to our emergency department (ED). Materials and methods This retrospective chart review was conducted between March 2017 and June 2019 in a single, urban academic ED with approximately 80,000 annual visits. The physician documentation was stored as combined PDF files by date. A Python program was developed to search the text from 186,987 encounters to find the string “scoot” and to extract the 100 characters before and after the phrase to facilitate a manual review of this subset of charts. Results A total of 890 charts were identified using the Python program, of which 235 (26.4%) were confirmed as e-scooter cases. Patients had an average age of 36 years and 53% were male. In 81.7% of cases, the patients reported a fall from the scooter and only 1.7% reported wearing a helmet during the event. The most commonly injured body areas were the upper extremity (57.9%), head (42.1%), and lower extremity (36.2%). The most frequently consulted specialists were orthopedic and trauma surgeons with 28% of cases requiring a consult. In our population, 9.4% of patients required admission to the hospital. Conclusions The number of results and data returned by the Python program was easy to manage and made it easier to identify charts for abstraction. The charts obtained allowed us to understand the nature and demographics of e-scooter injuries in our ED. E-scooters continue to be a popular mode of transportation, and understanding injury patterns related to them may inform and guide opportunities for policy and prevention."",2021,""{'url': 'https://www.cureus.com/articles/75967-utilization-of-automated-keyword-search-to-identify-e-scooter-injuries-in-the-emergency-department.pdf', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8667961, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The quantity of studies done on this subject has experienced significant growth. This study aims to provide an overview of this field by conducting a systematic review of literature that focuses on automatic hate speech identification, particularly in the Arabic language. The goal is to examine the research trends in Arabic hate speech identification and offer guidance to researchers by highlighting the most significant studies published between 2018 and 2023. This systematic study addresses five specific research questions concerning the types of the Arabic language used, hate speech categories, classification techniques, feature engineering techniques, performance metrics, validation methods, existing challenges faced by researchers, and potential future research directions. Through a comprehensive search across nine academic databases, 24 studies that met the predefined inclusion criteria and quality assessment were identified. The review findings revealed the existence of many Arabic linguistic varieties used in hate speech on Twitter, with modern standard Arabic (MSA) being the most prominent.

Recent works have shown unprecedented adoption of these for academic writing, especially in some fields, but their pervasiveness in astronomy has not been studied sufficiently. To remedy this, we extract words that ChatGPT uses more often than humans when generating academic text and search a total of 1 million articles for them. This way, we assess the frequency of word occurrence in published works in astronomy tracked by the NASA Astrophysics Data System since 2000. We then perform a statistical analysis of the occurrences. We identify a list of words favoured by ChatGPT and find a statistically significant increase for these words against a control group in 2024, which matches the trend in other disciplines. These results suggest a widespread adoption of these models in the writing of astronomy papers. We encourage organisations, publishers, and researchers to work together to identify ethical and pragmatic guidelines to maximise the benefits of these systems while maintaining scientific rigour."",2024,""{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17324, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Search terms related to topics of AI in otolaryngology were identified and queried to identify relevant articles. Conclusions AI is at the forefront of conversation in academic research and popular culture. In recent years, it has been touted for its potential to revolutionize health care delivery. Yet, to date, it has made few contributions to actual medical practice or patient care. Future adoption of AI technologies in otolaryngology practice may be hindered by misconceptions of what AI is and a fear that machine errors may compromise patient care. However, with potential clinical and economic benefits, it is vital for otolaryngologists to understand the principles and scope of AI. Implications for Practice In the coming years, AI is likely to have a major impact on biomedical research and the practice of medicine. Otolaryngologists are key stakeholders in the development and clinical integration of meaningful AI technologies that will improve patient care.

In medical fields, text mining has made valuable contributions in unexpected ways, not least by synthesizing data from disparate biomedical studies. This rapid scoping review examines how machine learning methods for text mining can be implemented at the intersection of these disparate fields to improve the workflow and process of conducting systematic reviews in medical research and related academic disciplines. Methods The primary research question that this investigation asked, “what impact does the use of machine learning have on the methods used by systematic review teams to carry out the systematic review process, such as the precision of search strategies, unbiased article selection or data abstraction and/or analysis for systematic reviews and other comprehensive review types of similar methodology?” A literature search was conducted by a medical librarian utilizing multiple databases, a grey literature search and handsearching of the literature. The search was completed on December 4, 2020. Handsearching was done on an ongoing basis with an end date of April 14, 2023. Results The search yielded 23,190 studies after duplicates were removed. As a result, 117 studies (1.70%) met eligibility criteria for inclusion in this rapid scoping review. Conclusions There are several techniques and/or types of machine learning methods in development or that have already been fully developed to assist with the systematic review stages. Combined with human intelligence, these machine learning methods and tools provide promise for making the systematic review process more efficient, saving valuable time for systematic review authors, and increasing the speed in which evidence can be created and placed in the hands of decision makers and the public."",2023,""{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': 'CCBYNCND', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10759980, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Employing artificial intelligence (AI) – supported search engines are increasingly suggested to achieve this.Reliably identify AAV patients in electronic health records (EHR) using an AI-based tool that incorporates text mining and Natural Language Processing (NLP).The identification method consists of a search strategy combined with NLP-based exclusion. A search strategy to optimally identify AAV patients within a single center EHR system of an academic hospital was developed using an established AAV cohort (n=203) as a gold-standard reference set. Patient records, identified by the search strategy outside of the reference set, underwent manual review to confirm newly-identified AAV patients. Then, improvement in performance by adding NLP to the text-mining search strategy was investigated. Validation was performed on an independent EHR system of a non-academic hospital with an established AAV cohort available for reference (n=84).The search strategy combined five queries based on disease description, laboratory measurements, medication and relevant specialisms. In the determination EHR, the search strategy identified 608 patients, including 197/203 (97.0%) AAV patients of the reference set and 149 newly-identified AAV cases confirmed by manual review. Employing NLP in the identification method improved the positive predictive value (PPV) from 57% (346/608 patients) to 78% (339/444 patients). These results were validated in an independent EHR system where the search strategy identified 333 patient, including 82/84 (97.6%) AAV patients of the reference set and 112 newly-identified AAV cases upon manual review. NLP improved PPV from 59% (194/333 patients) to 86% (192/223 patients). Negative predictive values and specificities were above 98% in all analyses.We present an AI based identification method to identify low-prevalent AAV patients in EHR systems. We demonstrated improved performance when adding NLP to the text-mining search strategy. Successful validation in an independent health organisation supports the applicability and transportability of this method which can be an important accelerator for research efforts and health care evaluation in AAV patients.[1]Kitching AR, Anders HJ, Basu N, Brouwer E, Gordon J, Jayne DR, et al.

"11a37999f061b2f95d763a491fd685c25dd3793d,Keyword Extraction from Scientific Publications Using Local Features and Embedding Model,""In the field of natural language processing (NLP), keywords are crucial for enhancing information retrieval (IR) and content summarization, as well as for optimizing search engines and organizing documents. As the volume of generated information increases, identifying keywords manually from large documents becomes more challenging and no longer feasible. Therefore, automatic keyword extraction is necessary as a cost-effective method to handle large documents and to provide scalable solutions for various applications in NLP and information management. In the academic domain, automatic keyword extraction simplifies the process of finding and categorizing scientific publications, enabling paper repositories to optimize their IR and document organizing systems. However, many methods of keyword extraction use either global semantic features based on pre-trained embedding models or local statistical features separately, which yields low results. Since a good keyword must be identified by both external knowledge and local statistical features, this paper proposes a method to improve the performance of keyword extraction from scientific publications by combining local statistical features with embedding models. The proposed method outperforms the baseline methods with an F-score of 0.70 on the SemEval2017 dataset using the SciBERT model and SVM classifier. This research confirms that both local statistical information and contextualized semantic information are important to identify keywords."",2023,""{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICSPIS59665.2023.10402723?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSPIS59665.2023.10402723, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Background: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmatic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a rare, life-threatening, systemic auto-immune disease. Due to the low prevalence and heterogenous registration, there is an urgent need to improve identification of AAV patients within the electronic health record (EHR)-system of health organizations to facilitate clinical research. Methods: Our aim was to identify, with a high sensitivity, low-prevalence AAV patients within large EHR-systems (>2.000.000 records) using an artificial intelligence (AI)-search tool. We combined a search on structured and unstructured data with natural language processing (NLP)-based exclusion. We developed the method in an academic center with an established AAV training set (n=203) and validated the method in a non-academic center with a validation set (n=84). We anonymously reviewed all identified patient records for AAV diagnosis. Results: The final search strategy combined four queries on disease description, laboratory measurements, medication and specialisms. In the training center, this search identified 608 patients, of which 346 were AAV patients upon manual review. 197/203 patients of the training set were retrieved, indicating a sensitivity of 97%. Employing NLP-based exclusion resulted in 444 patients with 339 AAV patients, resulting in an increase of positive predictive value (PPV) from 57% to 78% and a sensitivity of 96%. In the validation center the search strategy identified 333 patients, of which 194 were AAV patients, including 82/84 (98%) patients of the validation set. After NLP-based exclusion 223 patients remained, including 196 AAV patients, improving PPV from 58 to 86% with a sensitivity of 98%. Our identification method outperformed ICD-10 coding predominantly in identifying myeloperoxidase (MPO)-positive AAV patients and patients with few specialisms involved. Conclusions: We demonstrated excellent performance of an AI-based identification method, incorporating NLP, to identify AAV patients in EHRs and we validated the applicability and transportability. This method can accelerate research efforts, while avoiding the limitations of ICD-10-based registration."",2023,""{'url': '', 'status': None, 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1681/ASN.20233411S1102c?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1681/ASN.20233411S1102c, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

"99a1eacc40f918f60c1827cecfee554d2663b2d4,Polygenic Prediction of Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate in Individuals of African Descent and from the Americas,"". Background: Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmatic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a rare, life-threatening, systemic auto-immune disease. Due to the low prevalence and heterogenous registration, there is an urgent need to improve identification of AAV patients within the electronic health record (EHR)-system of health organizations to facilitate clinical research. Methods: Our aim was to identify, with a high sensitivity, low-prevalence AAV patients within large EHR-systems (>2.000.000 records) using an artificial intelligence (AI)-search tool. We combined a search on structured and unstructured data with natural language processing (NLP)-based exclusion. We developed the method in an academic center with an established AAV training set (n=203) and validated the method in a non-academic center with a validation set (n=84). We anonymously reviewed all identified patient records for AAV diagnosis. Results: The final search strategy combined four queries on disease description, laboratory measurements, medication and specialisms. In the training center, this search identified 608 patients, of which 346 were AAV patients upon manual review. 197/203 patients of the training set were retrieved, indicating a sensitivity of 97%. Employing NLP-based exclusion resulted in 444 patients with 339 AAV patients, resulting in an increase of positive predictive value (PPV) from 57% to 78% and a sensitivity of 96%. In the validation center the search strategy identified 333 patients, of which 194 were AAV patients, including 82/84 (98%) patients of the validation set. After NLP-based exclusion 223 patients remained, including 196 AAV patients, improving PPV from 58 to 86% with a sensitivity of 98%. Our identification method outperformed ICD-10 coding predominantly in identifying myeloperoxidase (MPO)-positive AAV patients and patients with few specialisms involved. Conclusions: We demonstrated excellent performance of an AI-based identification method, incorporating NLP, to identify AAV patients in EHRs and we validated the applicability and transportability.

This limitation may be overcome by a new web architecture known as semantic web which overcome the limitation of keyword based search technique called conceptual or semantic search technique. Natural language processing technique is mostly implemented in QA system for asking user's question and several steps are also followed for conversion of questions to query form for getting an exact answer. In conceptual search, search engine interprets the meaning of user's query and the relation among the concepts that documents contains with respect to a particular domain that produces specific answers instead of giving list of answers. In this paper, we proposed ontology based semantic information retrieval system and Jena semantic web framework in which, user enters an input query which is parsed by Standford Parser then triplet extraction algorithm is used. To all input query, SPARQL query is formed and then it is fired on the knowledge base (Ontology) that finds appropriate RDF triples in knowledge base and retrieve the relevant information using Jena framework."",2015,""{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1109/ICIIECS.2015.7193106?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIIECS.2015.7193106, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

The current scenario of assigning codes is a manual process which is very expensive, time-consuming and error prone. In recent years, many researchers have studied the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP), related Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods and techniques to resolve the problem of manual coding of clinical narratives and to assist human coders to assign clinical codes more accurately and efficiently. This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive overview of automated clinical coding systems that utilises appropriate NLP, ML and DL methods and techniques to assign ICD codes to discharge summaries. We have followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses(PRISMA) guidelines and conducted a comprehensive search of publications from January, 2010 to December 2020 in four academic databases- PubMed, ScienceDirect, Association for Computing Machinery(ACM) Digital Library, and the Association for Computational Linguistics(ACL) Anthology. We reviewed 7,556 publications"; 38 met the inclusion criteria. This review identified: datasets having discharge summaries;" NLP techniques along with some other data extraction processes, different feature extraction and embedding techniques. To measure the performance of classification methods, different evaluation metrics are used. Lastly, future research directions are provided to scholars who are interested in automated ICD code assignment. Efforts are still required to improve ICD code prediction accuracy, availability of large-scale de-identified clinical corpora with the latest version of the classification system.

We herein report our single academic institution experience with breast cancer OM with respect to anatomical presentation, histology (lobular vs. ductal), treatment, and survival. Methods We employed the natural language processing platform, TIES (Text Information Extraction System), to search 2.3 million de-identified patient pathology and radiology records at our institution in order to identify patients with OM secondary to breast cancer. We then compared the resultant cohort, the “OM cohort,” to two other representative metastatic breast cancer patient (MBC) databases from our institution. Histological analysis of selected patients was performed. Results Our TIES search and manual refinement ultimately identified 28 patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 1995 and 2016 that subsequently developed OM. Median age at diagnosis was 54 (range 28–77) years of age. ER, PR, and HER2 status from the 28 patients with OM did not differ from other patients with MBC from our institution. The relative proportion of patients with ILC was significantly higher in the OM cohort (32.1%) than in other MBC patients in our institution (11.3%, p  = 0.007). Median time to first OM in the OM cohort was 46.7 months, and OM were the second most frequent first metastases after bony metastases. After diagnosis of the first distant metastasis of any kind, median survival of patients with ILC (21.4 months) was significantly shorter than that of patients with IDC (55.3 months, p  = 0.03). Nine patients developed bilateral OM. We observed a significant co-occurrence of OM and central nervous system metastases ( p  = 0.0053). The histological analysis revealed an interesting case in which the primary tumor was of a mixed ILC/IDC subtype, while only ILC was present in the OM. Conclusions OM from breast cancer are illustrative of the difference in metastatic behavior of ILC versus IDC and should be considered when treating patients with ILC, especially in those with complaints of visual acuity changes."",2020,""{'url': 'https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13058-020-01309-3', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7318761, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

In this essay I briefly review the history of computational linguistics from its early days involving symbolic computing to current developments in NLP and set that in relationship to academic literary study. In particular, I discuss the deeply problematic struggle that literary study has had with the question of evaluation: What makes good literature? I argue that literary studies should own up to this tension and recognize a distinction between ethical criticism, which is explicitly concerned with values, and naturalist criticism, which sidesteps questions of value in favor of understanding how literature works in the mind and in culture. I then argue that the primary relationship between CL and NLP and literary studies should be through naturalist criticism.

Although there have been several attempts to review mHealth research through manual processes such as systematic reviews, the sheer magnitude of the number of studies published in recent years makes this task very challenging. The most recent developments in machine learning and text mining offer some potential solutions to address this challenge by allowing analyses of large volumes of texts through semi-automated processes. The objective of this study is to analyze the evolution of mHealth research by utilizing text-mining and natural language processing (NLP) analyses. The study sample included abstracts of 5,644 mHealth research articles, which were gathered from five academic search engines by using search terms such as mobile health, and mHealth. The analysis used the Text Explorer module of JMP Pro 13 and an iterative semi-automated process involving tokenizing, phrasing, and terming. After developing the document term matrix (DTM) analyses such as single value decomposition (SVD), topic, and hierarchical document clustering were performed, along with the topic-informed document clustering approach. The results were presented in the form of word-clouds and trend analyses. There were several major findings regarding research clusters and trends. First, our results confirmed time-dependent nature of terminology use in mHealth research. For example, in earlier versus recent years the use of terminology changed from """"mobile phone"""" to """"smartphone"""" and from """"applications"""" to """"apps"""". Second, ten clusters for mHealth research were identified including (I) Clinical Research on Lifestyle Management, (II) Community Health, (III) Literature Review, (IV) Medical Interventions, (V) Research Design, (VI) Infrastructure, (VII) Applications, (VIII) Research and Innovation in Health Technologies, (IX) Sensor-based Devices and Measurement Algorithms, (X) Survey-based Research. Third, the trend analyses indicated the infrastructure cluster as the highest percentage researched area until 2014. The Research and Innovation in Health Technologies cluster experienced the largest increase in numbers of publications in recent years, especially after 2014. This study is unique because it is the only known study utilizing text-mining analyses to reveal the streams and trends for mHealth research. The fast growth in mobile technologies is expected to lead to higher numbers of studies focusing on mHealth and its implications for various healthcare outcomes. Findings of this study can be utilized by researchers in identifying areas for future studies."",2017,""{'url': 'https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5803006?pdf=render', 'status': 'GREEN', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.21037/mhealth.2017.12.02?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.21037/mhealth.2017.12.02, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Machine Learning (ML) is becoming a more and more popular ﬁeld of knowledge, being a term known not only in the academic ﬁeld due to its successful applications to many real-world problems. The advent of Deep Learning and Big Data in the last decade has contributed to make it even more popular. Many companies, both large ones and SMEs, have created speciﬁc departments for ML and data analysis, being in fact their main activity in many cases. This current exploitation of ML should not mislead us";" while it is a mature ﬁeld of knowledge, there is still room for many novel contributions, namely, a better understanding of the underlying Mathe-matics, proposal and tuning of algorithms suitable for new problems (e.g., Natural Language Processing), automation and optimization of the search of parameters, etc. Within this framework of new contributions to ML, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has emerged strongly lately, speeding up ML calculations and providing alternative representations to existing approaches.

We herein report our single academic institution experience with breast cancer OM with respect to anatomical presentation, histology (lobular vs. ductal), treatment, and survival. We employed the natural language processing platform, TIES (Text Information Extraction System), to search 2.3 million de-identified patient pathology and radiology records at our institution in order to identify patients with OM secondary to breast cancer. We then compared the resultant cohort, the “OM cohort,” to two other representative metastatic breast cancer patient (MBC) databases from our institution. Histological analysis of selected patients was performed. Our TIES search and manual refinement ultimately identified 28 patients who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 1995 and 2016 that subsequently developed OM. Median age at diagnosis was 54 (range 28–77) years of age. ER, PR, and HER2 status from the 28 patients with OM did not differ from other patients with MBC from our institution. The relative proportion of patients with ILC was significantly higher in the OM cohort (32.1%) than in other MBC patients in our institution (11.3%, p = 0.007). Median time to first OM in the OM cohort was 46.7 months, and OM were the second most frequent first metastases after bony metastases. After diagnosis of the first distant metastasis of any kind, median survival of patients with ILC (21.4 months) was significantly shorter than that of patients with IDC (55.3 months, p = 0.03). Nine patients developed bilateral OM. We observed a significant co-occurrence of OM and central nervous system metastases (p = 0.0053). The histological analysis revealed an interesting case in which the primary tumor was of a mixed ILC/IDC subtype, while only ILC was present in the OM. OM from breast cancer are illustrative of the difference in metastatic behavior of ILC versus IDC and should be considered when treating patients with ILC, especially in those with complaints of visual acuity changes."",2020,""{'url': 'https://breast-cancer-research.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13058-020-01309-3', 'status': 'GOLD', 'license': 'CCBY', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1186/s13058-020-01309-3?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1186/s13058-020-01309-3, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

"f8ef8a36cf563395c07d3b75943e3efd7653cfdb,Utility of Blood Cultures and Empiric Antibiotics in Febrile Pediatric Hemophilia Patients With Central Venous Access Devices,""Background Children with hemophilia frequently require long-term central venous access devices (CVADs) for regular infusion of factor products. Hemophilia patients are not immunocompromised, but the presence and use of CVADs are associated with infections including bacteremia. Currently, the utility of blood cultures in evaluation of the febrile hemophilia patient with an indwelling CVAD is unknown, nor is optimal empiric antibiotic use. Methods We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study of febrile immunocompetent hemophilia patients with CVADs presenting to a large academic urban pediatric emergency department from 1995 to 2017. We used a natural language processing electronic search, followed by manual chart review to construct the cohort. We analyzed rate of pathogen recovery from cultures of blood in subgroups of hemophilia patients, the pathogen profile, and the reported pathogen susceptibilities to ceftriaxone. Results Natural language processing electronic search identified 181 visits for fever among hemophilia patients with indwelling CVADs of which 147 cases from 44 unique patients met study criteria. Cultures of blood were positive in 56 (38%) of 147 patients (95% confidence interval, 30%–47%). Seventeen different organisms were isolated (10 pathogens and 7 possible pathogens) with Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species as the most common. Thirty-four percent of isolates were reported as susceptible to ceftriaxone. Positive blood cultures were more common in cases involving patients with inhibitors (n = 71) versus those without (n = 76), odds ratio, 7.4 (95% confidence interval, 3.5–15.9). This was observed irrespective of hemophilia type. Conclusions Febrile immunocompetent hemophilia patients with indwelling CVADs have high rates of bacteremia.

There has been research into developing sophisticated methods and techniques for string searching. The common method is to make use of prefixes and suffixes to move through the text while searching a string query in a text. It suffers from high computational complexity since it has to repeatedly search each character in the string query sequentially. In this paper, we address the difficulty and propose a novel approach that enables a parallel search of the text without indexing the text or the query which is needed for sequential search.

To record faithfully discourse data collected, we incorporate in our corpus interactional linguistic features such as pauses, hesitations, fillers, repetitions, false starts etc.Approaching language from a functional approach, we believe linguistic features as such are non-trivial in that they may reveal cognitively and psychologically important details of language in use. Investigating spoken data in natural context makes it possible for us to explore issues beyond the scope offered by the traditional syntactic studies.

"8df523cc42d90ad916fcb9365a8f2e81346f33fc,Session 12: Information Retrieval,""Research in information retrieval is enjoying renewed interest by many different communities. Commercial retrieval systems, which in the past have concentrated on Boolean pat tern matching methodologies, are beginning to look into more sophist icated search methods, including complex stat istical and /o r natural language processing systems. This has spurred new interest in research in information retrieval in this community and also in the academic communities. Technology is being addit ionally pushed by the current emphasis on electronic communication, including digital libraries and the interlinking of oflices to allow ofrice automation. The availability of electronic text records in huge (and exponentially-growing) quantities, and the rapidly-expanding Internet access by potent ial users, is a third factor in promoting research. ARPA has contr ibuted to this increased interest by sponsoring a new test collection for information retrieval. The widespread availability of the T I P S T E R collection has allowed research on large-scale, real-world retrieval problems. This has not only opened up new areas of research tha t were not discovered using the smMler test collections, but has provided proof tha t the more complex retrieval systems do indeed scale up to handle realistic text collections. The first paper in this session, """"Overview of the Second Text Retrieval Conference (TREC-2) ' , by Donna Harman, i l lustrates the use of this collection in a massive crosssystem evaluation. The TREC-2 conference, held in August of 1993, compared results from 31 different retrieval systems working with the T I P S T E R collection. These systems used many different approaches to retrieval, including manually constructed patterns, automatical ly constructed stat is t ical queries that were input to stat ist ical retrieval systems, and natural language approaches to information retrieval. The paper discusses the T I P S T E R test collection, the evaluation methods used in TREC, and the results from the conference. The next two papers in the session represent systems that appeared in TREG-2. The first of these papers discusses a mostly stat is t ical system and the second of these papers discusses a system using natural language processing techniques. The paper """"Learning from Relevant Documents in Large Scale Routing Retrieval"""", by K.L. Kwok and L. Grunfeld, discusses experiments performed using a routing or filtering paradigm. This type of information retrieval assumes that users have a s tanding request for information, such as in an electronic dissemination service or an intelligence operation. There exists training information in the form of previously-seen documents considered relevant, and this training information is used to produce bet ter queries. This paper discusses in detail the problems of learning from fulltext relevant documents, which range in length from a short paragraph to many hundreds of pages. This problem is compounded by the availabili ty of large numbers of such relevant documents. Many experiments were performed to discover the opt imal method of selecting which (and what parts) of documents to use for training, and the results are given in the paper. The next paper, """"Document Representat ion in Natural Language Text Retrieval"""", by Tomek Strzalkowski, discusses experiments performed using mostly the adhoc retrieval paradigm. In this case the documents are known in advance, but the information is requested on an """"adhoc"""" basis. There is no training data , and systems are often required to deal with short user requests that might not map well onto the terminology used in the documents. One way around this problem is to automatical ly transform the user query into a linguistic s tructure that is expanded to bet ter map into the document collection. This paper presents a series of experiments in automatical ly locating useful lingulstic fragments of documents to match against such a modified user query. One of the main issues dealt with here is the correct term weighting for these fragments. Information retrieval is not l imited to the matching of textual material";" two of the papers in the session deal with speech retrieval systems. The first of these papers describes a modification of t radi t ional information retrieval methods to handle speech, whereas the second paper uses t radi t ional speech recognition technology with information retrieval as the application. The paper, """"Assessing the Retrieval Effectiveness of a Speech Retrieval System by Simulating Recognition Errors"""", by Peter Schauble and Ulrike Glavltsch, deals with retrieval of speech (speech """"documents""""). Their retrieval system uses phonetically motivated subword units as opposed to complete words for indexing of speech. The use of subwords as index terms means tha t the system can be used against either speech or text, and that techniques tradit ionally used in text retrieval can be modified for use with speech. The production of these subwords is dependent on current speech recognition technology, which is known to be error-prone. This paper presents some experiments using simulated speech recognition errors against well-known information retrieval test collections (textual) to see what effects these errors have on retrieval performance. The second of these papers, """"Speech-Based Retrieval using Semantic Co-Occurrence Fil tering"""", by Julian Kupiec, Don Kimber, and Vijay Balasubramanian, uses a s tandard hidden Markov model as input to a text retrieval system. The issue in this paper is how to deal with the very large (generally unrestricted) vocabulary size that is normal for most text retrieval applications.

This is because of their huge advantages, which include ease of usage, quick generation of answers to requests, and the human-like intelligence they possess. This paper presents a vivid comparative analysis of the top 9 generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, namely ChatGPT, Perplexity AI, YouChat, ChatSonic, Google's Bard, Microsoft Bing Assistant, HuggingChat, Jasper AI, and Quora's Poe, paying attention to the Pros and Cons each of the AI tools presents. This comparative analysis shows that the generative AI tools have several Pros that outweigh the Cons. Further, we explore the transformative impact of generative AI in Natural Language Processing (NLP), focusing on its integration with search engines, privacy concerns, and ethical implications. A comparative analysis categorizes generative AI tools based on popularity and evaluates challenges in development, including data limitations and computational costs. The study highlights ethical considerations such as technology misuse and regulatory challenges. Additionally, we delved into AI Planning techniques in NLP, covering classical planning, probabilistic planning, hierarchical planning, temporal planning, knowledge-driven planning, and neural planning models. These planning approaches are vital in achieving specific goals in NLP tasks. In conclusion, we provide a concise overview of the current state of generative AI, including its challenges, ethical considerations, and potential applications, contributing to the academic discourse on human-computer interaction.  "",2024,""{'url': 'https://publikasi.dinus.ac.id/index.php/jcta/article/download/9447/4379', 'status': 'HYBRID', 'license': 'CCBYNC', 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.62411/jcta.9447?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.62411/jcta.9447, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

However, significant progress comes hand-in-hand with substantial risks. Addressing them requires broad engagement with various fields of study. Yet, little empirical work examines the state of such engagement (past or current). In this paper, we quantify the degree of influence between 23 fields of study and NLP (on each other). We analyzed ~77k NLP papers, ~3.1m citations from NLP papers to other papers, and ~1.8m citations from other papers to NLP papers. We show that, unlike most fields, the cross-field engagement of NLP, measured by our proposed Citation Field Diversity Index (CFDI), has declined from 0.58 in 1980 to 0.31 in 2022 (an all-time low). In addition, we find that NLP has grown more insular -- citing increasingly more NLP papers and having fewer papers that act as bridges between fields.

Training a large number of neural networks requires an exceptional amount of computational power, which makes NAS unreachable for those researchers who have limited or no access to high-performance clusters and supercomputers. A few benchmarks with precomputed neural architectures performances have been recently introduced to overcome this problem and ensure reproducible experiments. However, these benchmarks are only for the computer vision domain and, thus, are built from the image datasets and convolution-derived architectures. In this work, we step outside the computer vision domain by leveraging the language modeling task, which is the core of natural language processing (NLP). Our main contribution is as follows: we have provided search space of recurrent neural networks on the text datasets and trained 14k architectures within it"; we have conducted both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of the trained models using datasets for semantic relatedness and language understanding evaluation;" finally, we have tested several NAS algorithms to demonstrate how the precomputed results can be utilized.

Educators have developed tools such as the Quality of Assessment for Learning (QuAL) tool to evaluate the quality of narrative assessment comments";" however, scoring the comments generated in medical education assessment programs is time intensive. The authors developed a natural language processing (NLP) model for applying the QuAL score to narrative supervisor comments. Method Samples of 2,500 Entrustable Professional Activities assessments were randomly extracted and deidentified from the McMaster (1,250 comments) and Saskatchewan (1,250 comments) emergency medicine (EM) residency training programs during the 2019–2020 academic year. Comments were rated using the QuAL score by 25 EM faculty members and 25 EM residents. The results were used to develop and test an NLP model to predict the overall QuAL score and QuAL subscores. Results All 50 raters completed the rating exercise. Approximately 50% of the comments had perfect agreement on the QuAL score, with the remaining resolved by the study authors. Creating a meaningful suggestion for improvement was the key differentiator between high- and moderate-quality feedback. The overall QuAL model predicted the exact human-rated score or 1 point above or below it in 87% of instances. Overall model performance was excellent, especially regarding the subtasks on suggestions for improvement and the link between resident performance and improvement suggestions, which achieved 85% and 82% balanced accuracies, respectively. Conclusions This model could save considerable time for programs that want to rate the quality of supervisor comments, with the potential to automatically score a large volume of comments. This model could be used to provide faculty with real-time feedback or as a tool to quantify and track the quality of assessment comments at faculty, rotation, program, or institution levels."",2024,""{'url': '', 'status': 'CLOSED', 'license': None, 'disclaimer': 'Notice: This abstract is extracted from the open access paper or abstract available at https://api.unpaywall.org/v2/10.1097/ACM.0000000000005634?email=<INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL> or https://doi.org/10.1097/ACM.0000000000005634, which is subject to the license by the author or copyright owner provided with this content.

Based on user inputs, search engines are able to present users with lists of related contents (links) and previews. More recently, high-level human-like responses combining various searched contents are being made possible due to recent advancements in large language models (LLM). However, oftentimes, users still find it still hard to quickly navigate to the contents they really look for and demand a better searching framework. For example, some users might waste time skimming through lots of technical details when they just hope to have an overview. We examine this user demand and believe a complexity-aware pipeline could greatly help with this inconvenience. More specifically, we propose a searching paradigm that analyzes results from standard search engines by their complexities first, and then present users with complexity-labeled contents through a new user interface design. Through this new searching paradigm, we aim to present users with more customized search results sorted by their complexity labels with consideration to user intent, whether that would be a high-level overview or a detailed technical inspection.

Patterns and trends in abundant data sources such as weather reports, news articles, and social media may provide insights into potential impacts and early warnings of impending disasters. This paper reviews the peer-reviewed studies (journals and conference proceedings) that used NLP to assess extreme weather events, focusing on heavy rainfall events. The methodology searches four databases (ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, and IEEE Xplore) for articles published in English before June 2022. The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis reviews and meta-analysis guidelines were followed to select and refine the search. The method led to the identification of thirty-five studies. In this study, hurricanes, typhoons, and flooding were considered. NLP models were implemented in information extraction, topic modeling, clustering, and classification. The findings show that NLP remains underutilized in studying extreme weather events. The review demonstrated that NLP could potentially improve the usefulness of social media platforms, newspapers, and other data sources that could improve weather event assessment. In addition, NLP could generate new information that should complement data from ground-based sensors, reducing monitoring costs. Key outcomes of NLP use include improved accuracy, increased public safety, improved data collection, and enhanced decision-making are identified in the study.
