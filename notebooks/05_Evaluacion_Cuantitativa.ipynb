      "  -> Documento Representativo: summary in 1995 the american college of sports medicine and the centers for disease control and prevention published national guidelines on physical activity and public health. the committee on exercise and cardiac rehabilitation of the american heart association endorsed and supported these recommendations. the purpose of the present report is to update and clarify the 1995 recommendations on the types and amounts of physical activity needed by healthy adults to improve and maintain health. development of this document was by an expert panel of scientists, including physicians, epidemiologists, exercise scientists, and public health specialists. this panel reviewed advances in pertinent physiologic, epidemiologic, and clinical scientific data, including primary research articles and reviews published since the original recommendation was issued in 1995. issues considered by the panel included new scientific evidence relating physical activity to health, physical activity recommendations by various organizations in the interim, and communications issues. key points related to updating the physical activity recommendation were outlined and writing groups were formed. a draft manuscript was prepared and circulated for review to the expert panel as well as to outside experts. comments were integrated into the final recommendation. primary recommendation to promote and maintain health, all healthy adults aged 18 to 65 yr need moderate-intensity aerobic (endurance) physical activity for a minimum of 30 min on five days each week or vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity for a minimum of 20 min on three days each week. [i (a)] combinations of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity can be performed to meet this recommendation. [iia (b)] for example, a person can meet the recommendation by walking briskly for 30 min twice during the week and then jogging for 20 min on two other days. moderate-intensity aerobic activity, which is generally equivalent to a brisk walk...\n",
      "  -> Documento Representativo: precision oncology has evolved into focusing on matching the most accurate and effective treatments based not only on the genetic profile of the patient and his/her cancer, but also on other unique characteristics that distinguish one patient from another. each patient has a unique genome, proteome, epigenome, microbiome, lifestyle, diet, and other characteristics that all interact to influence oncogenesis, disease progression, effective treatment options, drug tolerance, remission, and relapse. cancer comprises several hundred heterogeneous diseases, meaning that differences exist not only between cancer cells from various patients, but also between cancer cells within a single patient. cancer is constantly developing characteristics to evade death and this is why no single drug has been effective in “curing” cancer. precision oncology now involves using a combination of the unique characteristics of each patient to direct immunotherapy and targeted therapies.1 many advances in research over the past year reflect these ideologies of precision oncology. here we describe a few recent policy and research advances in the field of precision oncology. most recently, the focus has shifted from treating cancer based on type and histology to treating the specific cancer mutation. fda policies have paved the way for the adoption of “big data” genetic profiling techniques to guide patient therapies, such as those described by the nci-match (molecular analysis for therapy choice) or the nci-mpact (molecular profiling-based assignment of cancer therapy) initiatives. in june 2017, the fda granted regular approvals for using a combination of dabrafenib (i.e., a braf inhibitor) and trametinib (i.e., a mek inhibitor) to treat patients if they had metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) with the braf v600e mutation. this regimen was first approved by the fda in 2014 to treat melanomas in patients with braf mutations, and in 2017, researchers reported that the combination of da...\n",

      "  -> Documento Representativo: recommender systems algorithms are generally evaluated primarily on machine learning criteria such as recommendation accuracy or top-n precision. in this work, we evaluate six recommendation algorithms from a user-centric perspective, collecting both objective user activity data and subjective user perceptions. in a field experiment involving 1508 users who participated for at least a month, we compare six algorithms built using machine learning techniques, ranging from supervised matrix factorization, contextual bandit learning to q learning. we found that the objective design in machine-learning-based recommender systems significantly affects user experience. specifically, a recommender optimizing for implicit action prediction error engages users more than optimizing for explicit rating prediction error when modeled with the classical matrix factorization algorithms, which empirically explains the historical transition of recommender system research from modeling explicit feedback data to implicit feedback data. however, the action-based recommender is not as precise as the rating-based recommender in that it increases not only positive engagement but also negative engagement, e.g., negative action rate and user browsing effort which are negatively correlated with user satisfaction. we show that blending both explicit and implicit feedback from users through an online learning algorithm can gain the benefits of engagement and mitigate one of the possible costs (i.e., the increased browsing effort)....\n",
